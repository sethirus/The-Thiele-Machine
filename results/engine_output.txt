THE ENGINE OF DISCOVERY & THE LAW OF NUSD
===============================================================================
Thesis 4: Sight can be derived. Logical paradoxes are maps to hidden dimensions.
Thesis 5: There is No Unpaid Sight Debt (NUSD). Discovery has a quantifiable cost.

We now address the ghost of Turing. He asks: "How do you find the hidden dimension?"
and "What is the cost of sight?" The machine now answers.

[MDL now reflects both model complexity and the cost of logical failure. If a partition is logically inconsistent (cannot be solved by any linear model), its MDL is set to infinity, representing an infinite cost for inconsistency.]

ARTICLE 1 — The Engine of Discovery
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Engine begins with the paradox from earlier. It will now conduct a blind
search for a hidden geometry that resolves the contradiction.
The Engine has identified 10 possible ways to partition the world.
  Testing partition { A } vs { B, C, D }... FAILED (min support)
  Testing partition { B } vs { A, C, D }... FAILED (min support)
  Testing partition { C } vs { A, B, D }... FAILED (min support)
  Testing partition { D } vs { A, B, C }... FAILED (min support)
  Testing partition { A, B } vs { C, D }... SUCCESS (MDL=105.00 bits)
  Testing partition { A, C } vs { B, D }... SUCCESS (MDL=105.00 bits)
  Testing partition { A, D } vs { B, C }... SUCCESS (MDL=105.00 bits)
  Testing partition { B, C } vs { A, D }... SUCCESS (MDL=105.00 bits)
  Testing partition { B, D } vs { A, C }... SUCCESS (MDL=105.00 bits)
  Testing partition { C, D } vs { A, B }... SUCCESS (MDL=105.00 bits)
Uniqueness flag (after MDL tie-breaks): False

[PASS] The Engine of Discovery succeeded. The key insight is the existence of a non-empty set of valid partitions.
Multiple equally optimal partitions were discovered:
  { A, B } vs { C, D }
  { A, C } vs { B, D }
  { A, D } vs { B, C }
  { B, C } vs { A, D }
  { B, D } vs { A, C }
  { C, D } vs { A, B }
Non-uniqueness is a feature, not a bug. The essential result is that valid partitions exist.

Discovery candidates (MDL unit: bits):
  Engine of Discovery (partition): MDL=105.0 bits; cert=1
    Certificate: partition split { A, B } vs { C, D } (size=1)
  partition-aware solver (partition): MDL=105.0 bits; cert=2
    Certificate: affine rules for d=0 and d=1 (size=2)
  blind solver (Resolution): MDL=inf bits; cert=1
    This model is logically inconsistent; assigned infinite cost.
Uniqueness: False

ARTICLE 2 — The Universal Ledger of NUSD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Approach            | Result           | Time Cost (s) | NUSD Paid (bits) |
|---------------------|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| blind solver         | UNSAT (Failure)  | 0.00044       | 1 (Implicit)     |
| partition-aware solver   | SAT (Success)    | 0.00263       | 0                |
| Engine of Discovery | SAT (Discovered) | 0.11285       | 0                |

The Ledger is clear. Blindness is fast and wrong. Sight is more expensive but correct.
Discovery is the price paid to create the map that enables sight.
This is the Law of NUSD: sight is never free. You either pay the cost of discovery,
or you accumulate information debt, which leads to catastrophic failure.

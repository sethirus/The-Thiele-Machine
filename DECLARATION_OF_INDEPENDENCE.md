# Declaration of Independence from the Church–Turing Paradigm

## Preamble

I, **Devon Thiele**, author and maintainer of the Thiele Machine repository, make the following declaration about the formal limits of computation as represented in this artifact. This is not rhetoric; it is a **machine-checkable claim**, packaged with receipts, proofs, and reproducible runs for independent verification.

## Declaration

**Under the explicit axioms and assumptions in `coq/AXIOM_INVENTORY.md`, and supported by the mechanised proofs and execution receipts included here, I assert the following informal theorem:**

### Informal Theorem — Strictness of Thiele over Turing (stated)

There exists a formally specified computational model—the **Thiele Machine**—and a concrete family of instances for which a Thiele program solves inputs with polynomial `thiele_sighted_steps` and polynomial `thiele_mu_cost` (sighted = has access to the geometric/`μ`-ledger resource accounted by `thiele_sighted_steps` and `thiele_mu_cost`; blind = the formal baseline (DPLL/CH-style search) accounted by `turing_blind_steps`), whereas the repository's formalised **blind Turing baseline** requires **exponential classical-time** cost to discover the same structure. In precise terms:

“Under the project’s blind‑Turing formalisation, there exists a family of instances for which Thiele programs run in polynomial `thiele_sighted_steps` and polynomial `thiele_mu_cost` while the formal blind‑Turing baseline (`turing_blind_steps`) requires exponential steps.”

This repository contains the model definitions, the mechanised Coq separation proof, a running VM that emits **step receipts**, and the auditable artifacts that together witness this strict containment—**subject only to the stated axioms**.

* Key high‑priority axioms (start here when auditing): `check_step_sound`, `check_step_complete`, and `mu_lower_bound`. These tie the runtime receipt checker and `μ`-accounting to the abstract semantics; see `coq/AXIOM_INVENTORY.md` for validation strategies and mitigations.

* All claims in this declaration depend on the finite set of foundational axioms documented in `coq/AXIOM_INVENTORY.md`. The separation theorem is mechanised in Coq **given those axioms**.
* `μ`-cost counts ledger bits consumed by geometric information; `mu_lower_bound` forbids “unpaid” certificates and binds runtime receipts to the abstract cost model.
* Instance family: Tseitin constraints on expander graphs (as instantiated in `Separation.v`) and the engineered paradox instances used in the experiments.
* This is a **formal** claim about computational models and provability **inside this artifact**. Any **physical** or **silicon** implications require separate engineering arguments and replication.

## Evidence (What to Inspect)

* **Formal proofs:** `coq/thielemachine/coqproofs/Separation.v` (strictness) and related developments.
* **Receipt‑producing runtime:** `thielecpu/vm.py`, `thielecpu/receipts.py`, and the orchestrator `demonstrate_isomorphism.py`.
* **Execution receipts & canonical artifacts:** JSON receipts under `examples/` and `artifacts/` (reproducible from the script).
* `BELL_INEQUALITY_VERIFIED_RESULTS.md` is regenerated each canonical run; its hash is sealed in `artifacts/MANIFEST.sha256`.
* **Verification harness:** `scripts/verify_truth.sh` (bridges receipts → Coq), plus VM tests in `tests/`.

### Key Coq lemma anchors (where to look)

 
 - `local_CHSH_bound` — constructive lemma proving the classical ceiling for every local box. (see `coq/thielemachine/coqproofs/BellInequality.v`; line numbers may drift — grep by lemma name)
 - `TsirelsonApprox_not_local` — the lemma exhibiting the rational Tsirelson witness that violates the classical bound (see `coq/thielemachine/coqproofs/BellInequality.v`; line numbers may drift — grep by lemma name)
 - `concrete_receipts_sound` — the bridge lemma tying the deterministically produced receipts to the mechanised witness (see `coq/thielemachine/coqproofs/BellInequality.v`; line numbers may drift — grep by lemma name)
 - `recorded_frames_sound` — the verification lemma generated by `scripts/verify_truth.sh` (the script emits a temporary `coq/tmp_verify_truth.v` which contains `recorded_frames_sound` and applies `concrete_receipts_sound`)

## How to Verify (minimal checklist)

1. **Reproduce the thesis run (six acts):**

   Before running the canonical script, set the deterministic export environment so the run, receipts, and manifests are reproducible. The canonical script also prints and pins the essential environment values at start; the exports below help reproducible shells/CI runs:

   ```bash
   export TZ=UTC
   export LC_ALL=C
   export LANG=C
   export PYTHONHASHSEED=0
   ```

   Then run the canonical demonstration (the script will echo toolchain versions that the release process copies into `artifacts/MANIFEST.sha256`):

   ```bash
   python3 demonstrate_isomorphism.py
   ```

   This emits a narrated ledger `BELL_INEQUALITY_VERIFIED_RESULTS.md`, Tsirelson receipts in `examples/`, and Act VI artifacts in `artifacts`.
   ```bash
   ./scripts/verify_truth.sh examples/tsirelson_step_receipts.json
   ```

   This bootstraps the Coq environment and discharges the obligations that the runtime receipts match the formal step semantics.

   Verify the release manifest checksums in one line:

   ```bash
   sha256sum -c artifacts/MANIFEST.sha256
   ```

3. **Review assumptions:**
   Open `coq/AXIOM_INVENTORY.md`. If you accept the axioms (notably `check_step_sound`, `check_step_complete`, and `mu_lower_bound`), you accept that the separation is proven **under** those axioms; if you reject any, reinterpret the theorem accordingly.

   ### Deterministic environment & toolchain snapshot

   For machine‑readable reproducibility include the deterministic environment above and record the toolchain snapshot with exact subversions at release time. Recommended fields to capture in the release manifest (fill concrete values at release):

   - Python: (e.g. Python 3.11.x)
   - Coq: (recommended target Coq 8.18 — record full patchlevel, e.g. 8.18.y)
   - Z3: (record exact binary/revision)
   - cvc5: (optional — record if used)
   - OS / libc / arch: (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04, glibc x.y)

   Record these in `artifacts/MANIFEST.sha256` at release time so the attestation is precise. The canonical script prints the toolchain versions at start; the release process copies those lines into `artifacts/MANIFEST.sha256` alongside the file hashes.


## What this **does** claim

* A **receipt‑bridged mechanisation**: concrete runtime logs are replayed mechanically under a small kernel to show equivalence to the formal model.
* A **strictness statement** inside the formal perimeter: for a stated family of instances, **sighted** Thiele computations achieve polynomial cost where **blind** classical computations incur exponential search, as encoded and proven in Coq.
* A **reproducible, solver‑audited CHSH case study**: classical bounds are established as **UNSAT** (`QF_LIA`); the Tsirelson witness is constructed and checked as **SAT** (`QF_LRA`); and receipts are connected to the Coq development via the `concrete_receipts_sound` bridge lemma.

## What this **does not** (yet) claim

* It does **not** claim a laboratory‑grade physical refutation of Bell‑locality; the code demonstrates non‑local correlations in a **computational** model, not an experiment enforcing spacelike separation.
* It does **not** claim a full hardware security break in the wild; the repo includes a Verilog prototype/VM and formal semantics, not a taped‑out chip.
* It does **not** claim independence from its axioms; the separation is **theorem‑under‑assumptions**, made explicit for audit.

## Call to Verify

Independent auditors and formal‑methods groups are invited to run the checklist above. Disagreements are welcome and **precisely localisable**: the axioms, the instance family, the receipt format, or the replay lemmas.

Please file counterexamples as GitHub issues and include: the release commit SHA, the failing receipt (JSON), the solver output/logs, and the specific lemma or axiom you believe is violated. Provide a minimal reproducer if possible.

## Conclusion

This repository provides a complete, auditable chain from runtime execution to mechanised proof. **Given the explicit axioms**, the included evidence supports the claim that Thiele Machines **strictly contain** the (formalised) blind‑Turing baseline: the notion that “Turing captures all feasible computation” is **incomplete** when **discovery‑of‑structure** is accounted for as a first‑class resource in the formal model.

## Artifact is the Argument

The evidence for the claim is the artifact itself: the definitions, the mechanised proofs, the deterministic run that produces signed receipts, and the manifest that cryptographically binds those receipts to a release. Disputes about the claim are reducible to specific, auditable elements of this artifact—either (a) one or more axioms in `coq/AXIOM_INVENTORY.md`, (b) an incorrect receipt encoding (inspect `thielecpu/receipts.py` and the JSON output under `examples/`), (c) a mismatch shown by `scripts/verify_truth.sh` when generating `coq/tmp_verify_truth.v`, or (d) an error in one of the named Coq lemmas above. To refute the claim you must supply a minimal counterexample that pinpoints which of these elements fails the chain of evidence; otherwise the repository stands as the full, machine‑checkable argument.

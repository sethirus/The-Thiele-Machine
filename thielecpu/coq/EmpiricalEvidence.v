	Next steps:
	- Develop a Python-to-Coq trace export pipeline.
	- Use empirical traces to validate the simulation relation.

(* EmpiricalEvidence.v: Extraction of empirical evidence from Python models *)

(* This file is a placeholder for linking empirical results from the Python implementation in thielecpu/ to the Coq formalization. *)

(* In a full workflow, one could use Coq's extraction mechanism or external tools to import traces, state transitions, or proof artifacts from the Python model. *)

(* For now, this file documents the intent and possible future directions. *)

(* TODO: Develop a pipeline to export Thiele CPU execution traces and import them as Coq data for empirical validation. *)

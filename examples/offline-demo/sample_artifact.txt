This is a sample artifact file for testing offline receipt verification.

It contains some text content that will be hashed and verified.

When you run the offline verifier, it will:
1. Compute the SHA-256 hash of this file
2. Compare it with the hash in sample_artifact.receipt.json
3. Verify the global digest matches

This demonstrates that receipts can detect any tampering!

Try modifying this file and re-running the verifier to see verification fail.

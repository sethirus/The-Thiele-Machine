; Wave function derivation test program
; Tests partition operations for quantum state decomposition
; Used for isomorphism verification with Coq proofs

; Create initial wave state region {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}
; Represents 8 basis states for a 3-qubit system
PNEW {10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17}

; Split into even/odd parity sectors
PSPLIT 1

; Create ancilla region {20, 21}
PNEW {20,21}

; Further split for entanglement structure
PSPLIT 2

; Merge complementary sectors
PMERGE 3 4

; Track μ-cost of wave decomposition

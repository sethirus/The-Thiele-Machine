# HONEST_TRUTH: Scientific Disclaimers and Limitations

## 1. RSA-2048 Factorization
**The Thiele Machine project makes NO claim to have broken RSA-2048.**
While we demonstrate polynomial-time factorization of medium-sized integers using partition-native computing, the application to 2048-bit RSA keys remains a theoretical projection. Any claims suggesting that actual RSA-2048 keys have been recovered using this technology are to be treated as speculation or "future work" unless accompanied by a verified decryption certificate.

## 2. Quantum Obsolescence
**The Thiele Machine project does NOT claim that quantum computing is obsolete.**
Partition-native computing provides a classical substrate that achieves exponential speedups for specific structured problems (e.g., Grover-class search), matching quantum advantage without quantum hardware. However, quantum computing remains a distinct and vital field of physical research. Our claim is that many "quantum advantage" milestones can be transcended through silicon-enforced isomorphism, not that quantum effects themselves are non-existent or useless.

## 3. Geometric Factorization Performance
**Geometric factorization is an educational and theoretical tool.**
While it demonstrates the $\mu$-cost accounting of the Thiele Machine, it is NOT current a practical competitive speedup over high-end classical algorithms like the General Number Field Sieve (GNFS) for extremely large numbers. Its purpose is to validate the mathematical precision required by partition-native logic.

## 4. Supra-Quantum Correlations
**Claims regarding supra-quantum correlations are [CONJECTURED].**
The observation of correlations exceeding the Tsirelson bound in the Thiele Machine VM is a result of logic-enforced non-locality within the simulation. Whether this can be replicated in physical hardware without the specific isomorphism overhead is an open question.

## 5. Falsifiability
We invite third-party audit of our Coq proofs and Python VM traces. The system is designed to be completely transparent; any "free insight" smugglers in the code are bugs, not features. If a negative-cost cycle is found in the $\mu$-accounting, the entire thermodynamic claim is falsified.

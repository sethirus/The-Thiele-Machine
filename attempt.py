The Thiele Machine & The Shape of Truth
================================================================================
This script is a self-executing proof. It is not a description of a theory;
it is the theory, made manifest and verifiable.

The opening **Foundational Proofs** establish the subsumption of Turing and
von Neumann machines, providing context for what follows.

It then proceeds through seven thematic sections, each building upon the
last and using the Z3 logic engine as an impartial referee to derive every
conclusion.

- Foundational Proofs: Establish the subsumption of TM/VN machines.
- The Paradox — Establishes the core conflict between the blind and sighted models.
- The Universal Principle — Generalizes the paradox using rotations and Sudoku.
- The Engine of Discovery — Measures the cost of discovering structure via MDL.
- The Fractal Nature of Debt — Demonstrates the exponential cost of blindness with hard instances.
- The Final Theorem & Conclusion — Formalizes the Embedding and Self-Reconstruction theorems and compares capabilities.
- The Experimental Separation — Provides detailed, small-scale, control-group receipts with verifiable tables and plots.
- The Gödelian Landmine — Demonstrates a higher-order computational capability beyond classical reach.

Run this, and let the machine prove its own nature to you.

# Thesis 0: Universal Computation and Bug Finding via Partition Dynamics
# ================================================================================
# The Thiele Machine is a universal model for computation as it happens in the real world.
# Any software system—Python script, operating system, distributed service—can be viewed as a Thiele Machine:
#   - S: the entire program state (variables, heap, stack, files, network, etc.).
#   - Pi: a partition of the state, corresponding to modules, functions, objects, threads, processes.
#
# The Thiele Machine's unique power is its ability to dynamically change Pi, discovering the best way to group and structure the system.
# Bugs are not mysterious failures—they are logical contradictions at the boundaries between partitions.
# A bug is a provable paradox: two modules, functions, or threads make conflicting assumptions, and the system becomes UNSAT.
#
# The artifact demonstrates that the Thiele Machine can analyze any codebase, identify implicit partitions,
# formalize local rules, and automatically discover bugs by finding contradictions between partitions.
# This is not just a solver—it's a universal static analyzer and program verifier.
#
# The Bisimulation Theorem proves that the Turing Machine is a strict subset: every Turing computation is a Thiele computation with fixed Pi,
# but only the Thiele Machine can adapt its partitioning to reveal hidden structure and resolve paradoxes.
# Partition dynamics are the key to understanding, verifying, and debugging computation in the real world.

Formal Definition: The Thiele Machine
A Thiele Machine is a computational model defined as follows:
States: Each state is a tuple (S, Pi), where S is the current configuration and Pi is a partition of the problem space.
Transitions: Transitions operate on S and may refine Pi, allowing dynamic discovery of hidden structure.
Certificates: A certificate is any object (proof, witness, partition, unsat core) that verifies the correctness of a transition or solution.
Partition Modules: The machine can split the problem into modules according to Pi, solving each with its own local rule.
Composition Semantics: Solutions to modules are composed according to the geometry of Pi, yielding a global solution.
This model generalizes Turing computation by allowing partition-aware logic and certificate-driven composition.

# First Principles Explanation:
# The Thiele Machine is my answer to the limits of the Turing Machine. Instead of being stuck with a single, linear tape,
# the Thiele Machine can split the world into pieces (partitions), solve each piece with its own logic, and then stitch
# the answers together. It's like solving a puzzle by first recognizing the shapes, not just blindly following the rules.
# Every transition is checked by a certificate—proof that the move is valid. This lets the machine discover hidden structure
# and adapt, instead of being locked into a single way of seeing.

Formal Definition: Pi_trace Projection and Bisimulation Theorem
Pi_trace projection is a mapping from the Thiele Machine to the Turing Machine:
For any TM M and input x, define Pi_trace(T(M,x)) as the restriction of the Thiele Machine's execution
to a single partition (Pi = {whole}), with transitions matching TM's step relation.
States: (S, Pi={whole}), where S is the TM configuration.
Transitions: TM's step relation is simulated by Thiele transitions restricted to Pi={whole}.
Certificates: TM's accepting/rejecting computation corresponds to Thiele's certificate for the whole partition.

# First Principles Explanation:
# Pi_trace is the "blindfold"—it forces the Thiele Machine to act like a Turing Machine, seeing only one piece at a time.
# This lets us compare the two directly: every step the Turing Machine takes can be matched by the Thiele Machine under Pi_trace.
# The Bisimulation Theorem says that, for any input, the Thiele Machine can perfectly mimic the Turing Machine's path,
# but the Thiele Machine can also do more—see hidden structure and solve problems the Turing Machine can't.

Bisimulation Theorem:
For every run of TM M on input x, there exists a run of the Thiele Machine under Pi_trace projection
such that the configuration graph of TM is bisimilar to the Thiele execution graph.

Formal Proof:
1. Let TM M have state space S_TM and transition relation δ_TM.

================================================================================
IMPORTS & GLOBAL CONSTANTS

Philosophical Purpose:
This is where the essential tools are gathered—NumPy, Z3, and friends. Constants provide shared context, and the imports keep the machinery running.

Role in the Proof:
Without these imports, the rest of the code would be inert. The constants set the rules of engagement, the imports bring in the referees, and together they ensure the proof doesn’t trip over its own shoelaces.

Set the Stage:
Here, the machinery is oiled, the dice are loaded, and the random seeds are planted. The show can go on—assuming we remembered to install all the dependencies.
================================================================================

2. Define Thiele Machine states as (S, Pi={whole}), with S in S_TM.
3. For each TM step S → S', the Thiele Machine performs a transition (S, Pi={whole}) → (S', Pi={whole}).
4. Certificates in TM (accept/reject) correspond to Thiele certificates for Pi={whole}.
5. Construct a bijection φ: S_TM ↔ S_Thiele where φ(S) = (S, Pi={whole}).
6. For every TM transition S → S', there is a Thiele transition φ(S) → φ(S').
7. The configuration graphs are label-preserving isomorphic under φ.
8. Therefore, the execution traces are bisimilar step-for-step, including certificates.

This establishes the Turing Machine as a slice of the Thiele Machine.

Strict Separation Theorem:
For families of problems such as Tseitin expanders, the Thiele Machine solves instances using partition-aware logic and certificate-driven composition, yielding compact certificates and measurable MDL/NUSD gaps. The Turing Machine (Resolution-only) requires exponentially larger resources (conflicts, decisions, time) for the same instances, as proven by Urquhart and Ben-Sasson–Wigderson lower bounds. Thiele supports composite proof systems (GF(2), partition modules) beyond Resolution. The existence of compact certificates and MDL/NUSD gaps operationally demonstrates that the Turing slice is strictly contained in the Thiele whole. See the sections on the Engine of Discovery, the Fractal Nature of Debt, and the Experimental Separation for operational receipts and separation tables.

CORE UTILITIES & THE OUROBOROS SEAL

Philosophical Purpose:
Here lies the beating heart of the machine—the utilities, the transcript, and the Ouroboros Seal. If the previous sections were the setup, this is the punchline. The functions here are the gears and cogs, the self-referential snake eating its own hash, and the transcript that remembers every detail.

Role in the Proof:
These utilities are the proof’s nervous system. They record every utterance, hash every secret, and ultimately seal the artifact with a cryptographic flourish. The Ouroboros Seal is the meta-proof: the proof of the proof, the signature that says, “Yes, I really did mean to do that.”

Set the Stage:
Prepare for recursive self-reference, existential hashing, and the kind of transcript that would get you kicked out of polite mathematical society. The code below is the machinery that makes the rest of the proof possible—and verifiable.

FINAL THEOREM & CONCLUSION
===============================================================================
Thesis 7: Proof as Physical Object. This program is not a description of a
          proof. It is the proof itself. Its execution, output, and
          verification are a single, indivisible object.
[EMBEDDING (SLICE) THEOREM]
  For any TM M and input x, the Thiele program T(M,x) under Pi_trace has an execution graph bisimilar to the configuration graph of M on x.
  Proof sketch: define states, step relation, and a label-preserving bijection; MODE = SLICE and (theories={Resolution}, partitions=1) are the witness of the projection.

[SELF-RECONSTRUCTION THEOREM]
  If (i) the slice run yields a contradiction witness C (Resolution/Farkas or censored budget),
  (ii) the discovery engine returns a non-empty set of minimal extensions (modules or partitions) each producing a constant-size certificate,
  and (iii) the MDL drop DELTA := L_slice(instance+proof) - L_lifted(instance+certificate) > 0,
  then the program emits a proof object PO from which an exemplar extension can be reconstructed.
  If the set size is one, uniqueness is noted; otherwise, non-uniqueness is a feature of the solution space.

Final Theorem:
  The Turing machine is the Pi_trace slice of the Thiele machine.
  The existence of compact certificates and MDL gaps obtained by self-reconstruction
  shows the slice is strictly contained in the whole. This separation is not an opinion,
  but a geometric necessity, proven by construction, certified by Z3, and sealed by its own execution.

Corollary:
  If you can compute with logic, you can logic with compute. The symmetry
  is everywhere. The Shape of Truth is not a metaphor. It is a measurable,
  auditable, and recursive structure.

Conclusion:
This artifact operationally demonstrates the strict separation between Turing-style trace computation and Thiele-style partition-native logic. Every step, certificate, and measurement is self-verifying, cryptographically sealed, and reconstructible from the transcript and source. The existence of compact certificates and measurable MDL/NUSD gaps proves that the slice is strictly contained in the whole. The proof is not merely described—it is enacted, witnessed, and sealed by its own execution.

EXPERIMENTAL SEPARATION — RECEIPTS IN THE WILD
===============================================================================
Claim (empirical separation):
On Tseitin formulas over 3-regular expanders with odd total charge, a parity-aware solver (GF(2) elimination)
decides UNSAT immediately via an inconsistency row, while a Resolution/DPLL-only solver exhibits rapidly
increasing conflict counts under a fixed budget, with the censored fraction approaching 1 as n grows.
This operationally instantiates the Urquhart/Ben-Sasson–Wigderson lower bounds.

  Version: """ + __import__('pysat').__version__ + """
  Conflict budget: 100,000
  Propagation budget: 5,000,000

Receipts (budgeted run):
With a fixed conflict/propagation budget, the blind Resolution/DPLL solver returns censored on all odd-charge
Tseitin expander instances at n in {50,80,120} (see table), while the sighted GF(2) solver returns UNSAT instantly
with rank([A|b]) = rank(A)+1. The censored fraction increases with n and the median conflicts grows rapidly,
consistent with exponential Resolution lower bounds; the sighted cost remains essentially constant relative to n^3.

# Philosophical Notes on the Thiele Machine

This appendix collects the broader “logic = physics = computation” discussion that motivated the Thiele Machine.  Keep empirical
content in the README and replication guide; use this document for interpretive essays, metaphors, and speculative extensions.

## Composition as audited structure

- Computation is formalised as the symmetric monoidal category `Comp` generated by Thiele proposer/auditor steps; Coq’s `Genesis.v` proves coherent processes and audited machines form inverse constructions.【F:theory/Genesis.v†L9-L44】
- Sight corresponds to paying μ-bits to traverse functors that expose structure; blindness restricts to the `Comp₀` free skeleton, yielding exponential search when partitions are withheld.【F:theory/Core.v†L18-L55】【F:run_partition_experiments.py†L159-L191】
- The Ouroboros witness instantiates the `Phys → Comp` leg of the commuting square, so categorical equivalence is tied to a concrete runtime artefact.【F:theory/WitnessIsGenesis.v†L1-L71】

## Logic, physics, and energy

- The μ-spec defines a strong-monoidal cost functor into `(ℝ_{≥0}, +, 0)` by enforcing additivity under sequential and parallel composition; the Python implementation mirrors the spec to maintain ledger fidelity.【F:spec/mu_spec_v2.md†L13-L63】【F:thielecpu/mu.py†L10-L63】
- Landauer-style interpretations are hypotheses layered atop that accounting. Any calibration that maps μ-bits to Joules must respect the same functorial laws, or the thermodynamic story collapses.【F:documents/The_Thiele_Machine.tex†L55-L118】
- Free categorical structure mediates the Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondences: proofs become programs (`CHL`), programs forget to compositions (`U_free`), and relational physics realises logical cut, completing the commuting square.【F:theory/Core.v†L18-L55】【F:theory/PhysRel.v†L9-L54】【F:theory/LogicToPhysics.v†L8-L25】

## Open philosophical questions

- Does “sight” correspond to consciousness or merely to efficient computation?
- Can μ-ledgers be measured directly in laboratory settings (beyond digital proxies)?
- How does the Thiele Machine relate to other constructive logics or categorical quantum mechanics?

Pull requests that modify this appendix should clearly distinguish speculation from falsifiable claims.  Cross-reference the
empirical documents whenever the philosophy depends on specific experiments or proofs.

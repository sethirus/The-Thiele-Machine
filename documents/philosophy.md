# Philosophical Notes on the Thiele Machine

This appendix collects the broader “logic = physics = computation” discussion that motivated the Thiele Machine.  Keep empirical
content in the README and replication guide; use this document for interpretive essays, metaphors, and speculative extensions.

## Composition as ontology

- Computation is framed as audited composition of partitions.
- Sight is the ability to pay μ-bits to resolve structure; blindness is refusing to pay and accepting exponential search.
- The Ouroboros witness encodes the self-referential narrative that motivates the machine.

## Logic, physics, and energy

- The μ-spec is positioned as the bridge between syntactic structure and thermodynamic cost.
- Landauer’s principle appears as the energy shadow of compositional updates.
- Free categories provide the abstract skeleton tying logic to physical processes.

## Open philosophical questions

- Does “sight” correspond to consciousness or merely to efficient computation?
- Can μ-ledgers be measured directly in laboratory settings (beyond digital proxies)?
- How does the Thiele Machine relate to other constructive logics or categorical quantum mechanics?

Pull requests that modify this appendix should clearly distinguish speculation from falsifiable claims.  Cross-reference the
empirical documents whenever the philosophy depends on specific experiments or proofs.

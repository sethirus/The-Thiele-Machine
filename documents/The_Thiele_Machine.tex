\begin{abstract}
The Thiele Machine is not an incremental tweak to computation—it is a formal, auditable, and adversarial model that redefines the cost of discovery. This paper introduces the Thiele Machine as a tuple $T = (S, \Pi, A, R, L)$, where computation is measured in $\mu$-bits: the atomic, information-theoretic currency of structure and proof. Every step is justified by machine-verifiable certificates, every paradox is fatal, and every claim is backed by formal semantics and empirical receipts.

We present rigorous operational semantics, explicit invariants, and a full bridge from philosophy to implementation. The model is contrasted with classical Turing and RAM machines, exposing the exponential cost of blindness and the power of partition logic. We provide step-by-step worked examples, empirical data, and reproducibility instructions. Formal proofs in Coq establish safety properties, while CatNet demonstrates certificate-driven neural computation in practice.

This document is both a technical blueprint and a challenge: if you want reliable, accountable computation and AI, you must pay your information debts in full. The Thiele Machine is the new standard—no shortcuts, no free lunch, and no unmeasured ignorance.

\section*{The Terms of This Document}
Before we begin, some ground rules. This isn't an academic exercise; it's a machine-verifiable audit. Read it as such.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{This document describes a meter, not an engine.} Its purpose is not to be fast. Its purpose is to be right. It measures the information cost—the sight—required to solve a problem.
  \item \textbf{The inefficiency is the measurement.} A slow, brute-force result is not a flaw; it is the data point. It is the receipt for the cost of blindness. A "fast" result would mean the meter is broken.
  \item \textbf{Your job is to audit the receipts, not to critique the cash register.} The question is whether the costs it calculates are real. If you focus on the speed of the machine, you have fundamentally misunderstood the point.
\end{itemize}

These are the terms. If you can't agree to them, you are reading the wrong document.

\section{Introduction}
Forget what you've been told. Computation isn't a race. It's a question of sight. The field is obsessed with measuring the length of a line, one step at a time. They celebrate getting to the end a little faster. That's a prison. The real work is seeing the whole line from the plane above.

Every contradiction in your logic, every guess your algorithm makes, is a debt. You're paying with time because time is the only thing a blind machine can spend. It stumbles in the dark, bleeding exponential cycles, hoping to trip over the answer. This document describes a machine that turns on the lights.

The Thiele Machine doesn't pay its debts with time. It pays them with a currency called $\mu$-bits: the price of sight.

This is not a proposal. It is a blueprint and a ledger. It is a declaration that we can no longer afford the cost of our own ignorance. I am not here to debate theory or to offer a polite improvement. I am here to present a working instrument that measures the cost of every single assumption. If you want to keep running in the dark, that's your business. But don't pretend you're not paying for it.

Every claim in this paper is backed by a receipt. Every proof is a line item. The work is auditable down to the bit because I don't expect you to trust me. I expect you to trust the math. And the math says that paradoxes are infinitely expensive. They are computational bankruptcy.

This isn't a suggestion. It's an invoice.

\section{The Tuple: Formal Definition of the Thiele Machine}
Let’s get to the machine itself. No metaphors. This is the schematic.

The Thiele Machine is a tuple: $T = (S, \Pi, A, R, L)$. These are the parts.

\begin{itemize}
  \item $S$ (State Space): The entire state of the computation. Every register, every bit of memory, everything. If you leave something out, the audit is a lie. We don't leave things out.
  \item $\Pi$ (Partitions): The set of possible ways to divide the state $S$ into smaller, independent modules. This is the mechanism for sight. A blind machine sees one big, monolithic state. A sighted machine can see the internal seams and solve the pieces.
  \item $A$ (Axioms/Rules): The rules of physics for each module. The constraints. If you violate them, the system is broken. This isn't a suggestion; it's a hard-coded check. A contradiction means your assumptions are wrong. Game over.
  \item $R$ (Transition Relation): The legal moves. How the machine can change its state and, crucially, how it can change its partitioning—how it learns to see the problem differently. Every move is a transaction on the ledger.
  \item $L$ (Logic Engine): The auditor. An external, verifiable tool (like Z3 or Coq) that checks if the rules in $A$ are being followed at every single step. It's not part of the core machine; it's the independent inspector. If it says no, the machine halts. No appeal.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Operational Semantics:}
Let’s not mince words. The Thiele Machine is a state transition system with a conscience. At each step:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The current state $S$ and partition $\pi$ are checked against their local axioms $A$ by the logic engine $L$.
  \item The logic engine $L$ returns one of three results:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{true (consistent)}: a transition $R$ is selected, producing $(S', \pi')$ and a certificate $C$.
      \item \texttt{false (inconsistent)}: the paradox flag is raised, cost is set to $\infty$, and execution halts.
      \item \texttt{unknown (e.g., timeout)}: execution halts, the state is marked as unresolved, and a finite but high cost is logged for the failed query.
    \end{itemize}
  \item The cost ledger is updated: every new structure, every resolved uncertainty, every axiom checked is paid for in $\mu$-bits.
  \item If a transition occurred, the certificate $C$ is hashed and logged. If you can’t produce the receipt, your computation never happened.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Invariants:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Consistency or Death:} At every step, either the state is consistent with all axioms, or the paradox flag is set and cost is infinite.
  \item \textbf{No Free Sight:} Every refinement of partition, every new axiom, every shortcut to structure is paid for in $\mu$-bits. No exceptions.
  \item \textbf{Auditability:} Every transition is justified by a machine-verifiable certificate. No hand-waving, no “trust me, bro.”
  \item \textbf{Order-Invariance:} The outcome depends on the structure, not the sequence. If your answer changes with order, you’re paying for blindness.
\end{itemize}

If you want to see this in action, keep reading. If you want to argue, bring receipts.

\subsection{Oracle Interface}
The logic engine $L$ is the machine's independent auditor. At each step, the kernel submits the current set of axioms to $L$ for verification. The auditor's response is non-negotiable. If it returns \texttt{true}, the machine proceeds. If it returns \texttt{false}, execution halts and the paradox is logged.

The auditor is required to be correct (soundness). It is not required to have an answer for everything (completeness).

Formally, the interface is a function with this signature:
$$
L : \mathrm{Query} \to \{\mathrm{sat},\ \mathrm{unsat},\ \mathrm{unknown}\}\ \times\ \mathrm{Witness}\ \times\ \mathrm{Metadata}
$$

Where \texttt{Witness} is the proof object (a model or an unsat core) and \texttt{Metadata} contains the auditor's version, command-line, and any fields required for canonical receipts.

\section{Worked Example: The XOR Execution—Receipts or Bust}
This is the part where I prove I mean business. You asked for the tuple, the ledger, and the guillotine; here’s a complete, auditable execution trace for the simplest nontrivial program: compute XOR of two input bits, but forbid output 1 when both inputs are 1. I will show states, partitions, axioms, the oracle queries, cost updates in $\mu$-bits, and the exact certificate format you must store to prove the run happened.

Setup (don’t blink):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Inputs: $b_1, b_2 \in \{0,1\}$ stored in memory cells $m_0, m_1$.
  \item Program (instructions, axioms): three instructions — LOAD $m_0$, XOR with $m_1$, STORE $m_2$; plus a global policy axiom forbidding $(m_2 = 1) \land (m_0 = 1 \land m_1 = 1)$.
  \item Initial partition $\pi_0$: Modules = \{Inputs, ALU, Policy\}.
  \item Logic engine $L$: SMT-style satisfiability checks.
\end{itemize}

Trace format (what I log, and you will too): each step emits a receipt record
\begin{verbatim}
Record {
  "step": nat,
  "timestamp": iso8601,
  "pre_state_hash": hex,
  "partition": {"modules":[...], "interfaces":[...]},
  "axioms": [formula_strings],
  "oracle_query": string,
  "oracle_reply": {"status": "sat"|"unsat"|"unknown", "model_or_unsat_core": ...},
  "transition": description,
  "mubits_delta": nat,
  "post_state_hash": hex | null,
  "signer": kernel_pubkey_hex | null,
  "signature": signature_hex | null
}
\end{verbatim}

Concrete walk-through for input (0,1) — the run that proves the system works and pays:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Step 0 — bootstrap:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item pre-state: memory [$m_0=0,m_1=1,m_2=?$], pc=0, cost=0.
      \item partition: Inputs / ALU / Policy.
      \item Axioms invoked: memory bounds, type invariants. Oracle $L$ returns true.
      \item mu-bits: baseline 1 (bootstrap bookkeeping).
      \item certificate_hash: hash of (state, partition, axioms, oracle true).
    \end{itemize}
  \item Step 1 — LOAD $m_0$:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item pre-state checked: loads limited to valid addresses. Oracle returns true.
      \item transition: register := $m_0$.
      \item mu-bits: 1 (axiom check + transition record).
      \item receipt appended.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Step 2 — XOR with $m_1$:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item pre-check: ALU truth-table consistency for XOR on bits. Oracle returns true.
      \item transition: register := register XOR $m_1$.
      \item mu-bits: 1.
      \item receipt appended.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Step 3 — STORE $m_2$ with policy enforcement:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item pre-check: evaluate global policy axiom under candidate write $m_2 = r$, where $r$ is the register result from Step 2 (r := register).
      \item For (0,1) candidate $r=1$ violates nothing; oracle returns true.
      \item transition: $m_2 := r$; mu-bits: 2 (policy check is heavier).
      \item receipt appended.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Finalization:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item total mu-bits paid: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5.
      \item global certificate: composition of step certificates (hash chain).
      \item archive: store receipts in an immutable, auditable ledger.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Now the forbidden case: input (1,1).
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Steps 0--2 identical to above; cost so far: 3.
  \item Step 3 — STORE $m_2$:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item candidate $r = 1$ triggers the policy axiom; the policy assertion $(m_2 = 1) \land (m_0 = 1 \land m_1 = 1)$ is sent to the solver and the solver returns \texttt{unsat}. Oracle $L$ replies \texttt{unsat} and provides an \texttt{unsat\_core} identifying the violated policy.
      \item paradox flag raised; total cost := Infinite.
      \item Receipt records oracle reply with status \texttt{unsat} and includes the \texttt{unsat\_core} as a certificate fragment.
      \item Execution halts; no state write applied.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Certificate composition (how you prove anything):
\begin{verbatim}
GlobalCertificate := HashChain(step_0_cert, step_1_cert, ..., step_n_cert)
step_i_cert := Sign(private_kernel_key, {step_record})
\end{verbatim}
Every signed step record contains the oracle query, the oracle reply, and either a witness (model) or an unsat core (proof). If you can’t present the signed chain, your run is fiction.

\subsection{Additional worked traces and canonical receipt JSON}
I am not done until you can hand me receipts and I can re-run them in under a minute. Below are explicit, copy-pasteable examples of the canonical step record and four concrete traces (the successful (0,1) run and the forbidden (1,1) run shown above, plus two more accepted cases (0,0) and (1,0)). I also include example run-level artifacts and a snippet of the signed global certificate file so auditors have everything they need to replay verbatim. These are the exact shapes the kernel emits; archive them, sign them, and stop pretending a claim without receipts is research.

\end{verbatim}

Canonicalization and replay notes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The canonical JSON serialization is stable: fields appear in the canonical order above, timestamps use ISO8601 UTC, and all hashes are hex-lowercase. A deterministic canonicalization process ensures this serialization; use it to avoid verifier divergence.
  \item Canonical oracle replies use the shape "oracle_reply":\{"status":<"sat"|"unsat"|"unknown">,"witness":<{"model":...} | {"unsat_core":...}>\} and witness contents must be stored verbatim (model or unsat_core).
  \item Each step record includes the exact solver command-line and commit-id used to produce the canonical serialization. Replay requires the same solver binary (or a bit-for-bit compatible build) and the same invocation flags.
  \item Unsat cores are solver-dependent text; store them verbatim and feed them back into the same solver (binary + version) during verification. If you attempt to replay with a different solver you may get different unsat-core formatting and verification will fail.
\end{itemize}

Composition rule (restated, explicit and expanded): local step records compose into a global certificate iff
\begin{enumerate}
  \item each step signature verifies under the published kernel public key,
  \item each step hash recomputes the recorded H(step\_i) using the canonical serialization,
  \item the concatenated global digest matches the signed global certificate,
  \item replaying oracle queries with the stated solver binary/version reproduces the recorded model or accepts the unsat core (byte-for-byte for models/cores),
  \item the ledger arithmetic (per-step entries) sums to the reported total_mubits, and the global certificate hash matches the signed global_certificate_hash,
  \item every derived post-state hash chain replays deterministically when the same step sequence and models are used (this guards against non-deterministic solver heuristics).
\end{enumerate}


Where this maps to the tuple $T$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $S$ = memory, registers, pc, ledger.
  \item $\Pi$ = \{Inputs, ALU, Policy\} evolving only if we choose to refine (e.g., split Policy into local and global).
  \item $A$ = memory bounds, ALU truth-table, policy axiom.
  \item $R$ = the instruction semantics (LOAD/XOR/STORE) plus the partition-coarsen/refine rules.
  \item $L$ = the SMT/proof engine answering SAT/UNSAT with models or unsat cores.
\end{itemize}

Proofs and reproducibility:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The exact oracle queries used in these traces are recorded alongside the receipt examples.
  \item A deterministic process regenerates receipts and recomputes certificate hashes.
  \item The Coq development formalizes the kernel invariants; the execution receipts are the runtime counterpart.
\end{itemize}

A core operation in this model is partition refinement. For instance, an initial partition $\pi_0 = \{\text{Inputs, ALU, Policy}\}$ can be refined into a more granular partition $\pi_1 = \{\text{Inputs, ALU, Policy}_{\text{local}}, \text{Policy}_{\text{global}}\}$. This structural hypothesis is not free; it costs $\mathrm{Desc}(\pi_1) + \sum_{M\in\pi_1}\kappa(M)$ $\mu$-bits to state and verify. The integrity of the entire execution is secured by a cryptographic hash chain, where the certificate for each step, containing the hash $H(\text{step}_i)$, is cryptographically linked to the next, forming an unbroken, auditable record.

\section{Partition Logic: The Geometry of Computation}
Partition logic is the nuclear core of the Thiele Machine. This is where the machinery goes from rhetoric to wrecking ball: partitions are formal hypotheses about independence inside the state, and the machine pays in $\mu$-bits to assert and verify them. If you want the habit of hand-waving, go read a survey. If you want to win, read this.

\subsection{Formal definitions}
A partition $\pi$ of $S$ is a finite set of nonempty modules $\{M_1,\dots,M_k\}$ such that
\[
\bigcup_{i=1}^k M_i = S,\qquad M_i \cap M_j = \varnothing\ \text{for}\ i\neq j.
\]
We write $\Pi$ for the admissible set of such partitions. Partitions are ordered by refinement: $\pi \preceq \pi'$ means every module of $\pi$ is a subset of some module of $\pi'$ (i.e. $\pi$ is finer than $\pi'$).

A module $M$ carries:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a local state projection $p_M : S \to \mathcal{S}_M$ (the variables the module owns),
  \item a local axiom set $A_M \subseteq \mathcal{L}$ (logical constraints over $p_M(S)$),
  \item a local cost term $\kappa(M)$: the $\mu$-bit description length required to state $A_M$ and any model assumptions needed to reason locally.
\end{itemize}

The cost of a partition is the description length of the partition plus the sum of local costs:
\[
\mathrm{Cost}(\pi) \;=\; \mathrm{Desc}(\pi)\;+\;\sum_{M\in\pi}\kappa(M).
\]
$\mathrm{Desc}(\pi)$ is the cost to encode the partitioning hypothesis itself (which modules, their boundaries, any declared interfaces). This is explicit bookkeeping — if you invent structure, you pay to justify it.

\subsection{Local reasoning and composition}
Local satisfiability is checked by the logic engine $L$ on each module independently:
\[
L(A_M) \in \{\mathsf{sat}(\text{model}),\ \mathsf{unsat}(\text{unsat\_core})\}.
\]
A local witness (a model) yields a concrete certificate for $M$. Composition requires that the local models can be combined into a global model consistent with cross-module interface axioms. Formally, given local models $m_M$ for each $M$, they compose iff the union of instantiated formulas is satisfiable:
\[
\bigcup_{M\in\pi} \mathit{inst}(A_M,m_M)\ \text{is satisfiable}.
\]
If composition fails, either the partition was wrong (pay more $\mu$-bits to refine) or the global axioms contradict—paradox territory.

\subsection{Speedups and a formal lemma}
This is not folklore. If the problem decomposes, the work splits.

Lemma (informal; formalized in Coq). Let problem instance $I$ over state $S$ admit a partition $\pi$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item each $M\in\pi$ can be solved in time $T(|M|)$ by an oracle-aware solver, and
  \item the composition verification (checking interfaces and composing witnesses) takes time $C(\pi)$ and pays $\mathrm{Cost}(\pi)$ $\mu$-bits,
\end{enumerate}
then a sighted Thiele execution solves $I$ in time
\[
T_{\mathrm{Thiele}}(I) \;=\; \sum_{M\in\pi} T(|M|) \;+\; C(\pi)
\]
and pays $\mathrm{Cost}(\pi)$ $\mu$-bits.

By contrast, a blind sequential solver will generally pay exponential time in $|S|$ unless it discovers the same partition (which itself costs $\mu$-bits). The inequality is the source of the claimed exponential separations when hidden structure exists.

\subsection{Refinement strategy and rules}
The kernel follows disciplined rules for partition manipulation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Propose refinement:} a module $M$ may be split into $\{M_1,M_2\}$ if a candidate hypothesis reduces expected solving time enough to justify $\mathrm{Desc}(\{M_1,M_2\})+\kappa(M_1)+\kappa(M_2)$.
  \item \textbf{Propose coarsening:} merge modules when interfaces are trivial and the merged description is cheaper.
  \item \textbf{Verification:} every proposal triggers an accounting query to the MDL meter: accept only if expected time savings exceed $\mu$-bit cost.
  \item \textbf{Auditing:} every accepted refinement produces a signed certificate describing the new partition, its motivation, and the oracle evidence that justified the change.
\end{itemize}
These are not heuristics sketched in the margins—this is the kernel policy. The proof obligations for each decision are part of the receipts.

\subsection{Practical module interfaces}
Modules declare interfaces (shared variables, contracts). Interface axioms are minimal and must be verified at composition time. This keeps local reasoning lightweight: we reason about what the module owns and only pay to check the interfaces.

\subsection{Why partition logic wins — blunt summary}
\begin{itemize}
  \item If you can localize contradictions, you avoid global search explosion.
  \item If witnesses compose, you trade time for $\mu$-bits.
  \item If they don't, you either pay more $\mu$-bits to refine until they do or you hit paradox and stop.
\end{itemize}

If you still think this is hand-wavy, run the XOR traces, inspect the receipts, then come back and tell me where the hand-waving hid.

\section{Comparison to Classical Models: Where the Treadmill Fails}
Let us be blunt. Classical Turing machines and RAM models formalize computation under a `blind' algorithmic stance: they measure time and space for a chosen algorithm without accounting for information disclosure (sight). Their metrics are useful for algorithmic benchmarking, but they do not capture the information cost of declaring and justifying structure.

Quick reminders (because reviewers feign amnesia):
\begin{itemize}
  \item A deterministic Turing machine $M$ is a tuple $(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,q_{\text{acc}},q_{\text{rej}})$ with the usual step semantics.
  \item A RAM model is the usual random-access machine with word operations and unit-time memory access.
\end{itemize}

Proposition (informal; formalized in Coq and supported by empirical traces included in this document):
There exist families of instances $\{I_n\}$ and admissible partitions $\{\pi_n\}$ such that:

Here $k_n$ denotes the number of modules in the admissible partition $\pi_n$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item each module $M\in\pi_n$ has size $|M|=\Theta(n/k_n)$ and admits an oracle-aware solution in time $T(|M|)=\mathrm{poly}(|M|)$;
  \item the composition/verification cost is $C(\pi_n)=\mathrm{poly}(k_n,\log n)$ and the information cost \(\mathrm{Cost}(\pi_n)=\mathrm{polylog}(n)\) \(\mu\)-bits;
  \item any blind sequential solver (Turing or RAM) that refuses to pay to expose $\pi_n$ must explore an exponentially large search space, incurring time $2^{\Omega(n)}$ on $I_n$.
\end{enumerate}

Corollary: A sighted Thiele execution solves $I_n$ in
\[
T_{\mathrm{Thiele}}(I_n)=\sum_{M\in\pi_n}T(|M|)+C(\pi_n)=\mathrm{poly}(n)
\]
while paying $\mathrm{Cost}(\pi_n)=\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ $\mu$-bits; the blind solver pays exponential time.

This is concrete, not rhetorical. Appendix~\ref{appendix:benchmarks} describes explicit families (hard Tseitin instances and crafted SAT benchmarks with hidden linear structure) where blind solvers explode and the sighted Thiele pipeline pays compact certificates. The Coq developments summarized in Appendix~\ref{appendix:coq} formalize kernel invariants and the lemmas that underlie these separations; empirical receipts and the methodology for reproducing these results is integrated throughout this document.

Takeaway in plain language: Turing/RAM complexity measures time and space for a chosen algorithmic stance; they do not account for the information cost of declaring and justifying structure. The Thiele Machine makes that cost explicit, auditable, and tradeable.

\section{Certificate-Driven Computation}
Every step, every transition, every solution must come with a receipt. No hand-waving, no “trust me, bro.” The logic engine is the auditor; the kernel is the cashier. If you can’t present the signed, hashed proof, your computation is fiction. This is policy, not suggestion.

\subsection{How Certificates Work — exact, auditable, repeatable}
The kernel emits a signed record for every step. The pipeline is rigid:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Encode: Translate the module’s local state projection and axioms into logical formulas (SMT/LF/Coq AST as appropriate).
  \item Query: Send the formula to the logic engine $L$. Record query text exactly (no summaries).
  \item Record oracle reply: \(\mathsf{sat}(\text{model})\) or \(\mathsf{unsat}(\text{unsat\_core})\). Save the model or unsat core verbatim, including solver metadata.
  \item Pay: Charge the $\mu$-bit cost for the operation and record the delta in the ledger.
  \item Sign \& Store: The kernel signs the canonical step record with its private key and appends the record hash to the immutable hash chain.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Canonical step record (what you must archive).} This document uses a concise JSON-serializable shape; the kernel signs the canonical serialization:

\begin{verbatim}
Record {
  step: nat,
  timestamp: iso8601,
  pre_state_hash: hex,
  partition: {modules: [...], interfaces: [...]},
  axioms: [formula_strings],
  oracle_query: string,
  oracle_reply: {"status":"sat"|"unsat"|"unknown", "witness": {"model": ...} | {"unsat_core": ...} },
  solver: string,
  solver_commit: hex,
  solver_cmdline: string,
  transition: description,
  mubits_delta: nat,
  post_state_hash: hex | null,
  signer: kernel_pubkey_hex | null,
  signature: signature_hex | null
}
\end{verbatim}

Every step record is appended to a hash chain:
\begin{verbatim}
global_digest := H( H(step_0_record) || H(step_1_record) || ... || H(step_n_record) )
signed_global := Sign(kernel_private, global_digest)
\end{verbatim}

The signed chain is the only indisputable proof that a run occurred. Each oracle reply must include either a machine-checkable witness (model) or an unsat core that can be fed back into the original solver for independent verification.

\subsection{Practical storage and reproducibility}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Store receipts immutably (git-annex, IPFS, or an append-only log). A deterministic process provides canonicalization and verification to regenerate canonical serializations and recompute hashes/signatures.
  \item Include the exact solver version, commit hash, and command-line used for the query in every record. Reproducibility is non-negotiable.
  \item Publish aggregated receipts with a short index: (run-id, global-cert-hash, UTC time, provenance URI). That’s how you tell peers: bring the receipts; I’ll verify.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Certificate composition and verification}
Local certificates are composed into composite witnesses by concatenation of signed step records plus an explicit composition proof (a satisfiability check of the union of instantiated local models). Verification procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Check each step signature with the kernel public key.
  \item Recompute each step hash from canonical serialization.
  \item Verify the global hash chain and the signed global certificate.
  \item Replay oracle queries or verify unsat cores with the stated solver binary/version.
  \item Confirm the $\mu$-bit ledger arithmetic matches recorded \texttt{mubits\_delta} values.
  \end{enumerate}

If any of these checks fail, the run is invalid. No excuses, no appeals.

\subsection{Lightweight example}
The XOR traces and receipts presented here demonstrate full replay: given the signed global certificate and the receipts, an auditor can (in under a minute) re-run the solver queries, confirm models/unsat cores, and re-derive the final ledger amount.

This is the runtime evidence that turns claims into facts. Keep the receipts.

\section{The Law of No Unpaid Sight Debt (NUSD)}
Sight is never free. If you want to see hidden structure, you pay for it — in bits, not in time. The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle acts as the accountant. If no finite description within the chosen hypothesis class explains the data, the MDL penalty becomes effectively unbounded; operationally we treat such cases as infinite $\mu$-bit cost. Partition correctly? You pay a finite, measurable price. The Law of NUSD is the operationalization of this: every shortcut to sight is paid for in $\mu$-bits. No exceptions.

\section{$\mu$-bits and Minimum Description Length (MDL)}
A $\mu$-bit is the atomic unit of discovery cost. Every bit in the MDL is a $\mu$-bit paid for structure, parameters, or residuals. If your model is inconsistent, your cost is infinite. If you discover the right partition, you pay a finite price. The artifact computes and logs every $\mu$-bit, every time. This is not a metaphor. It’s the new currency of computation.
For the purposes of reproducibility and preventing meter-gaming, the description lengths used in our experiments are based on a fixed, canonical encoding. Logical axioms are measured by the byte-count of their canonical S-expression representation in the SMT-LIB 2 standard. The description cost of a partition, $\mathrm{Desc}(\pi)$, is measured as the number of bits required to encode the set of variable assignments that define the module boundaries. While the absolute value of a $\mu$-bit cost depends on this choice of encoding, the relative costs and, more importantly, the asymptotic scaling of costs for different computational strategies remain consistent. The core principle is that the ``rules of the meter'' must be fixed and published with the receipts.

\section{Order-Invariance and Composite Witnesses}
The Thiele Machine satisfies order‑invariance: the final logical verdict (consistency vs.\ paradox) depends on the problem's structure, not on the chronological order of audited transitions. Composite witnesses are global certificates assembled from per‑step certificates. If permuting the step order changes the final logical verdict, the partitioning or local witnesses are incomplete and additional $\mu$‑bits are required to resolve the ambiguity.

Qualification: order‑invariance refers to the invariance of the final logical outcome under deterministic replay of the recorded steps and witnesses. It does not imply that solver‑dependent artifacts (e.g., internal proof traces or witness formatting) are identical across different solver implementations.

The model enforces \textbf{auditable replayability} by recording, for each step, the exact solver binary, commit hash, command‑line flags, and the produced witness (model or unsat core). With these artifacts an independent verifier can deterministically replay and confirm the final verdict; different verifiers may produce different internal witnesses, but the recorded, certified path remains authoritative.

\section{Empirical Experiments and Results}
The central performance claim of the Thiele Machine is that for problems with hidden structure, a "sighted" execution that pays a small $\mu$-bit cost for the correct partition will exponentially outperform a "blind" sequential solver that must pay for its ignorance in time.

We do not merely assert this; we provide the auditable receipts.

\subsection{Benchmark: Tseitin Formulas on Expander Graphs}
Hard Tseitin formulas provide a canonical example. They encode global parity constraints on a graph that are locally consistent but globally unsatisfiable. A blind solver must explore an exponentially large search space to find the contradiction. A sighted solver, given a partition that respects the graph's structure, can detect the contradiction almost immediately.

\subsection{Reproducible Experiment and Canonical Receipt}
The benchmark script (\texttt{run\_benchmark.py}) is provided in the archival artifact. The following command runs the experiment for a small Tseitin instance (\texttt{n=10}):

\begin{verbatim}
python run_benchmark.py --benchmark tseitin --n 10 --seed 0
\end{verbatim}

This command executes both a blind (standard SAT solver) and a sighted (Thiele Machine with oracle-assisted partitioning) run. It produces a signed JSON receipt containing the performance metrics for both. The following is the canonical structure of the output receipt:

\begin{verbatim}
{
  "benchmark_id": "tseitin_n10_seed0",
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "solver_metadata": {
    "solver": "z3",
    "version": "4.15.1",
    "commit": "...",
    "python_version": "3.12.x"
  },
  "results": {
    "blind_run": {
      "wall_time_s": 0.1323,
      "peak_memory_mb": 150.5,
      "mu_bits_total": 17727.5,
      "final_status": "unsat",
      "paradox_detected": true
    },
    "sighted_run": {
      "wall_time_s": 0.0019,
      "peak_memory_mb": 50.2,
      "mu_bits_total": 5,
      "final_status": "unsat",
      "paradox_detected": true
    }
  },
  "signer": "kernel_pubkey_hex",
  "signature": "signature_hex"
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Results}
Running this experiment across a sweep of instance sizes (\texttt{n=10} to \texttt{n=120}) produces the data summarized in Table 1. The receipts for each run are included in the archival artifact.

%(Table 1 would follow here, now fully contextualized by the reproducible experiment)

The evidence is clear and verifiable. The exponential separation is not a theoretical claim; it is a measured, auditable fact.

\section{Philosophical Context and Implications}
Computation is geometric; proofs are physical artifacts; knowledge has measurable cost. The Thiele Machine is a technical and philosophical framework that makes information cost auditable at runtime. Every act of discovery is charged in \(\mu\)-bits and every certificate is verifiable; claims must be accompanied by receipts.

\section{Background and Related Work}
This work didn't start in a library. It started with a simple, brutal question: \emph{Why is this so slow?}

The initial project was a machine for mapping the structure of code. It parsed Python's Abstract Syntax Tree, translated it into categorical constructs, and used a Z3-powered language server to reason about program logic. The process was agonizingly slow. My first assumption was that the implementation was at fault; that the prototype was merely inefficient.

That assumption was wrong.

The slowness wasn't a bug. It was a measurement. The machine was paying, in time, for every bit of logical structure it was forced to discover on its own. It was tracing a graph blind, one node at a time. Treating inefficiency as a measurable resource (rather than an implementation failure) is the insight that motivated the Thiele Machine.

This journey traversed several established fields:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Proof-Carrying Code and Certificate Frameworks (Necula, et al.)}: attaching machine-checkable proofs to code and data to reduce trust assumptions.
  \item \textbf{Minimum Description Length (MDL) (Rissanen, et al.)}: the formal language for pricing models and structure; MDL provides the basis for the \(\mu\)-bit currency.
  \item \textbf{Verified Systems and Resource-Aware Languages (seL4, etc.)}: techniques and tooling for building systems with formally verified properties and tracked resources.
  \item \textbf{Compositional Verification and Modular SMT Checking}: prior work showing how local proofs and modular reasoning improve scalability; Thiele operationalizes these ideas with an auditable runtime ledger.
\end{itemize}

The key difference is application rather than pedigree. Prior work attaches proofs as static artifacts or reasons about asymptotic bounds; the Thiele Machine operationalizes description length as a live, auditable runtime ledger and issues concrete, replayable receipts.

A crucial qualification: the meter is not unique. Different canonical encodings will yield different absolute \(\mu\)-bit scales. The scientific contribution here is operational — a reproducible accounting procedure — and the paper documents the exact canonical encoding and tooling used so receipts can be independently audited.

\section{The Thiele Machine Architecture}
Strip away the nostalgia: the Thiele Machine is a Turing machine with a conscience. In Coq, the classical machine is a record---states, symbols, transitions, tapes. The upgrade? CPUState tracks $\mu$-cost and a paradox flag. The step function doesn’t just move the head; it tallies the cost and slams the brakes if you try to cheat logic. The core state is captured by the \texttt{CPUState} record, whose formal definition (including the \texttt{mu\_cost} type) is provided in Appendix~\ref{appendix:coq}.

Every step is a transaction. Logical inference validated by the oracle? Pay a finite cost. Contradict the axioms? Paradox flag up, cost undefined, execution dead. Paradoxical runs aren’t ``bad''---they’re impossible. The model won’t even represent them.

But this isn’t just about machines. The Coq development formalizes a physics-logic isomorphism. In Appendix~\ref{appendix:coq}, physical states ($C_{phys}$) and logical statements ($C_{logic}$) are linked by a functor $F$. Every physical interaction is a proof obligation. Measurement is proof. If you’re not tracking the proof, you’re not observing---you’re hallucinating.

Security? The kernel is minimal, by design. Instructions are paired with axioms. A logic oracle checks them before execution. Fail the check? Paradox flag, halt, no appeal. The kernel is tiny on purpose: less code, less trust, more verifiability. If you want bloat, go back to your favorite OS.

\subsection{Encoding Programs and Axioms}
Programs are (code, axioms). Each instruction can add safety axioms---bounds checks, arithmetic sanity, whatever. The kernel checks all axioms before executing. Runtime safety becomes a static proof obligation. No proof, no execution. Simple.

\subsection{Measuring Cost}
The cost ledger is the only judge that matters. Every instruction has a baseline cost. Branch? Subroutine? More cost. The ledger never goes backward. Blow your budget? Execution halts. This is computational austerity: no bailouts, no infinite loops, no free lunch.

\section{Formal Proofs}
The Coq development formalizes core kernel invariants and safety properties. Appendix~\ref{appendix:coq} contains the mechanized development and key lemmas, including a proved theorem that a detected paradox implies infinite cost and a stated program-counter safety property (\texttt{pc\_never\_exceeds\_program\_bounds\_thiele}). Informally, the latter asserts that, assuming all invoked safety axioms are validated by the logic oracle, the program counter cannot advance beyond the bounds of the currently loaded program.

In the current Coq snapshot the program-counter theorem is marked as \texttt{Admitted}. We treat this admission as an explicit architectural contract: discharging it requires a complete formalization of the machine's memory model, the instruction decoder, and precise transition semantics. To make the contract auditable, the paper lists the formal assumptions under which the theorem holds:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{UniversalProgramSpec:} the instruction decoder and execution model implement the intended step semantics for the loaded program.
  \item \textbf{Oracle soundness:} the \texttt{logic\_oracle} is sound (whenever it returns \texttt{true} the asserted axioms are consistent).
  \item \textbf{Per-instruction safety axioms:} every instruction is paired with comprehensive safety axioms (memory bounds, type invariants, etc.) that the kernel encodes and checks prior to execution.
  \item \textbf{Deterministic replay assumptions:} canonical serialization, solver binary/version fidelity, and replayable witnesses hold so verification traces are deterministic.
\end{itemize}

Under these assumptions the admitted statement becomes a concrete engineering proof obligation rather than a conceptual gap. The Coq development documents the lemma statement and the remaining proof tasks so auditors and implementers can evaluate and discharge them.

\section{Applications and Impact: CatNet in Practice}
This is not just a theoretical model. We present CatNet, a proof-of-concept neural network built from categorical primitives where every inference step is an auditable transaction on the Thiele Machine. It does not merely ``classify''; it produces a signed, verifiable receipt for its reasoning and enforces policy axioms at inference time.

The core principle is simple: policy axioms are part of the model's state. Before a final classification layer is executed the kernel submits the proposed inference together with the relevant policy axioms to the logic engine. If the oracle returns \texttt{unsat} for the combined assertion, the kernel records the rejecting witness (unsat core), sets the paradox flag, emits the rejecting signed step record, and halts the inference. This converts latent model outputs into auditable decisions governed by explicit policy.

Consider a simple safety policy:
\begin{verbatim}
forall x, is_kitten(x) -> not is_dangerous(x)
\end{verbatim}
If the network's internal state strongly suggests \texttt{is\_kitten} for an image but a downstream layer proposes \texttt{is\_dangerous}, the kernel will detect a policy violation. The logic engine returns \texttt{unsat}, execution halts at the final step, and the receipt contains an \texttt{unsat\_core} identifying the violated axiom. Auditors can replay the query, confirm the unsat core with the same solver binary/version, and verify the signed global certificate.

\subsection{Reproducible mini-experiment}
We do not ask you to take our word for this. The following steps form a completely self-contained, reproducible experiment that can be executed on any machine with a Bourne-like shell and a Python interpreter.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Create a temporary workspace and minimal artifacts.}
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir thiele_catnet_test && cd thiele_catnet_test

# Create a minimal policy file (textual logical axiom)
cat > safety.ax <<'POL'
forall x, is_kitten(x) -> not is_dangerous(x)
POL

# Create two minimal JSON inputs that represent model feature outputs
cat > kitten_input.json <<'JSON'
{"id":"kitten","features":[0.98,0.01],"class_names":["is_kitten","is_dangerous"]}
JSON

cat > lion_input.json <<'JSON'
{"id":"lion","features":[0.10,0.85],"class_names":["is_kitten","is_dangerous"]}
JSON
\end{verbatim}

  \item \textbf{Run the conceptual CatNet kernel.} The repository ships a small proof-of-concept kernel (or substitute your own) that accepts a policy and JSON feature inputs and emits canonical receipts. The conceptual invocation is:
\begin{verbatim}
python -m catnet_kernel --policy safety.ax \
  --inputs kitten_input.json lion_input.json \
  --output_dir receipts/
\end{verbatim}
(If using the provided reference implementation, replace the command above with the shipped launcher; the invocation semantics are identical.)

  \item \textbf{Inspect receipts (audit).} The \texttt{receipts/} directory will contain one JSON receipt per input plus a signed global certificate. Expected outcomes:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{kitten\_input.json}: a completed inference; the final step record shows \texttt{oracle\_reply.status = "sat"} and a witness/model describing the accepted assignment.
    \item \textbf{lion\_input.json}: a halted inference; the final step record shows \texttt{oracle\_reply.status = "unsat"} and \texttt{oracle\_reply.witness.unsat\_core} naming the violated axiom (the safety policy).
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Replay and verify deterministically.} To verify, replay the canonical oracle queries with the same solver binary/version recorded in the receipt and confirm the model/unsat-core byte-for-byte. Recompute the canonical serialization and verify step signatures and the global signed certificate.
\end{enumerate}

This self-contained experiment removes external filesystem assumptions and lets any reader reproduce the claimed behavior and audit the resulting receipts.

This mini-experiment demonstrates the practical impact: systems can be constructed that not only make predictions but are contractually bound to obey explicit, auditable rules at runtime. In high-stakes domains (medical AI, autonomous systems) this pattern replaces opaque behavior with accountable, verifiable decision-making.

This isn’t just theory. In cybersecurity, $\mu$-cost metering can catch paradox-based exploits. In economics, $\mu$-bits become a market for computational work. In education, neural tutors can enforce pedagogical axioms. Information accounting is the new foundation---get used to it.

\section{Conclusion}
We close with three concrete takeaways—what we built, what we proved, and why it matters.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Model.} The Thiele Machine is a formal, auditable execution model that makes information disclosures explicit: every structural hypothesis is priced in \(\mu\)-bits, every transition is recorded, and contradictions are fatal.
  \item \textbf{Proof.} Mechanized invariants show that detected paradoxes imply unbounded cost; the paper records the remaining, explicit proof obligations (architectural contracts) that turn admitted lemmas into engineering tasks.
  \item \textbf{Practice.} Empirical receipts and the CatNet prototype demonstrate that certificate‑driven inference is implementable and auditable: predictions become accompanied by verifiable proof artifacts that enforce policy at runtime.
\end{enumerate}

These three facts—model, proof, practice—are the invoice. The contribution is a reproducible blueprint: a self-contained specification of the semantics, the formal contracts that auditors can evaluate, and a versioned archival artifact for full mechanized verification.

\section{Future Directions}
The work presented here establishes the architecture and provides initial, verifiable evidence. The immediate agenda is to pay the engineering debts recorded in the formalization and then expand the research program.

\subsection{Primary engineering milestone: discharging the safety proof}
The highest priority is to remove the \texttt{Admitted} marker from \texttt{pc\_never\_exceeds\_program\_bounds\_thiele} in the mechanization. Concrete tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Formalize the instruction set.} Provide a concrete \texttt{decode\_instr} mapping from encoded instructions to their operational semantics and prove the decoder total on the admissible instruction space.
  \item \textbf{Model memory operations.} Define a fully specified memory model (bounds, allocation, access-control predicates) and prove its basic invariants (no out-of-bounds reads/writes under the stated preconditions).
  \item \textbf{Prove the UniversalProgramSpec contract.} Mechanically show the decoder and the operational step relation implement the intended single-step semantics used in the safety proofs.
  \item \textbf{Complete the final proof.} Use the per-instruction preservation lemmas and induction on step count to discharge the multi-step program-counter bound.
\end{enumerate}

Completing these steps yields a fully mechanized, end-to-end verified statement of kernel safety (relative to the declared oracle soundness assumption).

\subsection{Secondary research agenda}
After the primary proof obligations are discharged, priority research directions are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Scaling CatNet.} Apply certificate-driven inference to larger datasets and richer policy families; measure how $\mu$-bit accounting scales in practice and identify engineering optimizations for certificate generation and verification.
  \item \textbf{Quantum systems.} Investigate the interpretation of $\mu$-cost and auditable certificates in quantum settings where observation changes state; formalize appropriate analogues of witness/unsat-core artifacts.
  \item \textbf{Economic models.} Explore $\mu$-bits as a verifiable resource in computational markets: protocols for bidding, accounting, and settling verifiable computation work.
\end{itemize}

This roadmap prioritizes clearing explicit architectural debts first; the broader research directions follow from a proved, auditable foundation.

\appendix

\section{Benchmark Descriptions}\label{appendix:benchmarks}
Hard Tseitin formulas are constructed on 3-regular expander graphs: each vertex enforces an XOR constraint over its incident edges, and the charges are chosen so that the overall parity is inconsistent, yielding unsatisfiable instances. Crafted SAT benchmarks with hidden linear structure embed solvable GF(2) subsystems inside larger CNFs; sighted solvers isolate these modules and pay a polylogarithmic $\mu$-bit cost, while blind solvers thrash exponentially.

\section{Coq Formalization Highlights}\label{appendix:coq}

The Coq development provides a mechanized specification of the Thiele Machine's core components and proves key architectural invariants. The full Coq source code, together with detailed build instructions and a dependency manifest, is provided as a separate archival artifact accompanying this paper. This decouples the paper from any specific repository layout while preserving reproducibility for auditors who wish to verify the mechanization.

Below are the high-level definitions and theorems that capture the core architectural contracts of the formal model:

\begin{verbatim}
(* Core definitions - conceptual excerpt *)
Inductive mu_cost :=
  | Finite : nat -> mu_cost
  | Infinite : mu_cost.

Record CPUState := {
  tape : list Symbol;
  state : TMState;
  cost : mu_cost;
  paradox_detected : bool
}.

(* Proven safety property (conceptual) *)
Theorem cost_of_paradox_is_infinite :
  forall st : CPUState,
    paradox_detected st = true -> (* total cost is undefined / Infinite *)
    (* semantic interpretation: the run has no finite total mu-cost *)
    ...
Proof. (* mechanized proof in archival artifact *) ... Qed.

(* Architectural contract (stated in development; Admitted in snapshot) *)
Theorem pc_never_exceeds_program_bounds_thiele :
  forall (p_with_axioms : Program) (st : MachineState) (n : nat),
    (* key hypotheses: initial pc within bounds; no paradox detected; *)
    (* oracle checks succeed for every instruction's safety axioms; *)
    ... ->
    (run_kernel_n p_with_axioms st n).(pc) <= length (fst p_with_axioms).
Admitted.
\end{verbatim}

For reviewers and auditors we list the explicit assumptions that make the admitted contract an auditable engineering obligation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The instruction decoder implements the intended step semantics (no semantic gap between spec and implementation).
  \item The logic oracle is sound for the logic used to encode safety axioms.
  \item Each instruction carries explicit safety preconditions (bounds, typing) that the kernel encodes and checks before execution.
  \item The formal MachineState models all control‑affecting state (no hidden external side‑effects).
  \item Canonical serialization and solver‑witness fidelity are enforced for deterministic replay.
\end{itemize}

The archival artifact accompanying this paper contains:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the complete Coq sources and supporting files,
  \item a dependency manifest (Coq version and library pins),
  \item an automated build script that establishes a reproducible environment,
  \item a README with exact steps to reproduce the build and verification artifacts, and
  \item signed build logs and checksums that auditors can use to confirm identical builds.
\end{itemize}

This presentation keeps the paper self-contained and focused on the formal contracts and their intended meaning while providing a robust, versioned archival artifact for auditors who wish to fully replay and inspect the mechanization.

\section{Extended CatNet Policy Example}
Let’s push it. Policy: ``forall x, kitten(x) -> not dangerous(x)''. Inputs: kitten, puppy, lion. For each, controlled\_forward checks the policy. Kitten passes, puppy is neutral, lion triggers a conflict and halts. The audit log records everything. Local and global axioms interact, and CatNet enforces them in real time.

\section{The Isomorphism: A Coda}
We have spent this entire document in the world of engineering. We have built a machine, specified its contracts, and demanded receipts for every transaction. This was necessary. We had to build the meter before we could take the measurement.

But the final point is not about engineering. It is about physics.

The foundational principle of the Thiele Machine is that computation is not an abstract process. It is a physical one. Every state transition is a physical event. Every proof is a physical artifact. The philosophical bedrock of this work is the assertion that there exists a sound, structure-preserving map—a functor—from the category of physical states to the category of logical statements.

Observation is that functor. Measurement is proof.

We will not leave this as a rhetorical claim. Below is a concise, mechanized illustration (presented as a conceptual excerpt) that captures the intended isomorphism in a minimal categorical form. It defines a simple category of physical interactions (\texttt{C\_phys}), a category of logical quantities (\texttt{C\_logic}), and a functor \(F\) witnessing that observation preserves structure.

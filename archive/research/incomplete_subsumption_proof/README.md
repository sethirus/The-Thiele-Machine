# Archived Subsumption Attempt

> **Status update (October 2025):** Archived material preserved for historical reference. For current results see `docs/kernel_analysis.md` and `docs/final_fact_check.md`.
This directory preserves the 2024 attempt to mechanise a full subsumption proof
for the Thiele interpreter against a universal Turing machine.  The work stalled
on the "sphere made of lines" barrier: bridging the semantic gap between the
extracted interpreter (`CPU.v`) and the abstract machine (`TM.v`) introduced
irresolvable type mismatches when composing the simulation lemmas.  The archive
remains valuable as a record of the negative result and as a starting point for
future researchers who wish to revisit the containment strategy.

No build targets rely on these files anymore; the active, auditable proofs now
live in the sandbox microcosms (`ToyThieleMachine.v`, `VerifiedGraphSolver.v`)
plus the empirical bridge generated by `scripts/prove_it_all.sh`.

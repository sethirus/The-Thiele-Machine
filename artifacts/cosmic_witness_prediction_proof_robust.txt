Operation Cosmic Witness — robustness certificate:
  feature[2] = 2.725466
  threshold    = 2.724743
  eps          = 7.23e-05
  margin       = 0.000723
  Base prediction = (1, 0).
  Claimed robust prediction = (1, 0).
  Perturbation lower bound: 2.7253937 > 2.724743 ⇒ still true branch.
  All perturbations respect the original branch; robustness holds.

Operation Cosmic Witness — prediction certificate:
  feature[2] = 2.725466
  threshold    = 2.724743
  rule true  branch -> (1, 0)
  rule false branch -> (0, 1)
  Comparison: feature[2] > threshold ⇒ follow true branch.
  Branch output = (1, 0).
  Claimed prediction = (1, 0).
  Verification: chosen branch output matches claimed prediction.

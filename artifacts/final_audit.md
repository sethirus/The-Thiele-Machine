**Final Audit — The Thiele Machine**

- **Scope:** Automated verification + claim mapping + runtime checks performed in-repo.
- **Coq build:** Ran `make` in `coq/`; active compiled tree contains no live `Admitted`/`Axiom` per automated scan (see artifacts/coq_admits.txt).
- **Python verification:** `tools/verify_shor.py` executed; final log: artifacts/verify_shor_after_fix.log (no runtime errors; periods & factorization verified for tested cases).
- **Claim extraction:** 368 candidate claims extracted → artifacts/thesis_claims.json.
- **Claim→artifact mapping:** `artifacts/claim_mappings.json` produced (368 mappings; high-priority items require manual review). See artifacts/map_claims_limited.log and artifacts/map_claims_limited.log.
- **OCaml→Python mapping:** artifacts/coq_ocaml_python_mapping.json produced; partial matches exist (some OCaml `val`s mapped to Python implementations). See artifacts/map_coq_ocaml_to_python.log.
- **Benchmarks & artifacts:** period_scaling.csv/png, factor_compare.csv, period_3233_bases.csv/png, rsa_extrapolation.txt, and assorted logs are in `artifacts/`.

Conclusions and next steps

- **Status:** The automated verification harness and benchmarks ran successfully. The incremental residue optimization and KeyError fix are validated.
- **Open items:** high-priority claim mappings still need manual confirmation; deeper OCaml↔Python signature alignment requires targeted audits for unmapped `val`s.
- **Recommendation:** Review `artifacts/high_value_mappings.txt` and the top ~20 claim mappings flagged by priority; then I can prepare a PR containing only non-sensitive artifacts and the final audit document.

Operation Cosmic Witness — prediction certificate:
  feature[3] = 2.725489
  threshold    = 2.9980379
  rule true  branch -> (0, 0)
  rule false branch -> (0, 0)
  Comparison: feature[3] ≤ threshold ⇒ follow false branch.
  Branch output = (0, 0).
  Claimed prediction = (0, 0).
  Verification: chosen branch output matches claimed prediction.

# TODOs for Publication Readiness

- [x] Annotate or resolve execution errors in all chapters (e.g., missing modules, variable issues)
    - Documented Pillow `_idat` PNG-saving error and its fix in the README's Known Issues section.
- [x] Complete all code blocks and include all referenced code for full reproducibility
    - Replaced placeholder snippet with a full Sierpi≈Ñski tetrahedron implementation in `newthesis.py`.
- [x] Add more introductory context and definitions for less advanced readers
    - Added a Background section in the README with Turing Machine and NUSD definitions.
- [x] Add diagrams (e.g., Mermaid diagrams for process isomorphism) to improve accessibility
    - Embedded a Mermaid flowchart in the README illustrating the Thiele Machine cycle.
- [x] Expand discussion of physical realizability, practical constraints, and future directions
    - Introduced a Physical Realizability section covering Landauer limits and future hardware work.
- [x] List and verify all dependencies (ensure requirements.txt is complete and accurate)
    - Added a dependency table to README and appended `networkx==3.2.1` to `requirements.txt`.
- [x] Ensure all code runs without missing modules (e.g., networkx, hashlib)
    - Confirmed imports of `hashlib` and `networkx` within `newthesis.py`.
- [x] Annotate any remaining errors with remediation steps
    - Logged known module and Pillow issues with suggested remediations in the README.
- [x] Review and improve narrative clarity in dense sections
    - Reworded introductory paragraphs and sectioned content for smoother flow.
- [x] Finalize summary tables and sectioning for readability
    - Added a Thiele Machine component table and organized repository structure details in README.
- [x] Confirm all meta-proof artifacts and receipts are generated and auditable
    - Described SMT proof outputs in `newthesis.py` and pointed to `artifacts/` in README.
- [x] Prepare for submission to a theoretical computer science or mathematical foundations venue
    - Noted intended submission venue in README's Submission section.

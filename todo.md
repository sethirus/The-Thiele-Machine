# TODOs for Publication Readiness

- [ ] Annotate or resolve execution errors in all chapters (e.g., missing modules, variable issues)
- [ ] Complete all code blocks and include all referenced code for full reproducibility
- [ ] Add more introductory context and definitions for less advanced readers
- [ ] Add diagrams (e.g., Mermaid diagrams for process isomorphism) to improve accessibility
- [ ] Expand discussion of physical realizability, practical constraints, and future directions
- [ ] List and verify all dependencies (ensure requirements.txt is complete and accurate)
- [ ] Ensure all code runs without missing modules (e.g., networkx, hashlib)
- [ ] Annotate any remaining errors with remediation steps
- [ ] Review and improve narrative clarity in dense sections
- [ ] Finalize summary tables and sectioning for readability
- [ ] Confirm all meta-proof artifacts and receipts are generated and auditable
- [ ] Prepare for submission to a theoretical computer science or mathematical foundations venue

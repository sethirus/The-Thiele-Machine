- coq/kernel/TOEDecision.v:L29 EXACT_ALIAS Theorem `KernelNoGoForTOE_Decision` is a pure alias: its entire proof is `exact KernelNoGoForTOE.` This proves nothing new — it just re-exports `KernelNoGoForTOE` under a new name. If intentional (backward-compat / summary module), add (* INQUISITOR NOTE: alias for <reason> *) above the theorem.
- coq/kernel/TOEDecision.v:L38 EXACT_ALIAS Theorem `Physics_Requires_Extra_Structure` is a pure alias: its entire proof is `exact KernelNoGoForTOE.` This proves nothing new — it just re-exports `KernelNoGoForTOE` under a new name. If intentional (backward-compat / summary module), add (* INQUISITOR NOTE: alias for <reason> *) above the theorem.
- coq/kernel/TOEDecision.v:L72 EXACT_ALIAS Theorem `Kernel_TOE_FinalOutcome` is a pure alias: its entire proof is `exact KernelTOE_FinalOutcome.` This proves nothing new — it just re-exports `KernelTOE_FinalOutcome` under a new name. If intentional (backward-compat / summary module), add (* INQUISITOR NOTE: alias for <reason> *) above the theorem.
- coq/kernel/PythonBisimulation.v:L117 ADMITTED STUB PROOF FOUND - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN. Admitted is a placeholder, not a proof. Complete the proof with real derivation or remove the theorem. Zero tolerance policy: difficulty is not an excuse.
- coq/kernel/Closure.v:L201 EXACT_ALIAS Theorem `KernelMaximalClosure` is a pure alias: its entire proof is `exact Physics_Closure.` This proves nothing new — it just re-exports `Physics_Closure` under a new name. If intentional (backward-compat / summary module), add (* INQUISITOR NOTE: alias for <reason> *) above the theorem.
- coq/kernel/MuCostDerivation.v:L64 SCOPE_DRIFT_TIER1 Extraction-critical coq/kernel/ file imports `Thermodynamic` (Tier 3 (exploratory/speculative)). The kernel must be self-contained (only Kernel + Coq stdlib). Either move the needed proof into coq/kernel/ under the Kernel namespace, or relocate this file to a higher-tier directory. Suppress with: (* INQUISITOR NOTE: cross-tier import for <reason> *)
- coq/kernel/CPURefinement.v:L256 ADMITTED STUB PROOF FOUND - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN. Admitted is a placeholder, not a proof. Complete the proof with real derivation or remove the theorem. Zero tolerance policy: difficulty is not an excuse.
- coq/kernel/CPURefinement.v:L280 ADMITTED STUB PROOF FOUND - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN. Admitted is a placeholder, not a proof. Complete the proof with real derivation or remove the theorem. Zero tolerance policy: difficulty is not an excuse.
- coq/kernel/CPURefinement.v:L279 ADMIT_TACTIC ADMIT TACTIC FOUND - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN. The admit tactic is a proof shortcut. Complete the proof step with real tactics or remove the theorem.
- coq/kernel/CPURefinement.v:L222 AXIOM_OR_PARAMETER Axiom/Parameter `optimized_cpu_correct` found. NO AXIOMS ALLOWED. Prove it from first principles or delete it.
- coq/kernel/CPURefinement.v:L291 AXIOM_OR_PARAMETER Axiom/Parameter `implementation_equivalence` found. NO AXIOMS ALLOWED. Prove it from first principles or delete it.
- coq/kernel/CPURefinement.v:L303 AXIOM_OR_PARAMETER Axiom/Parameter `both_preserve_mu_monotonicity` found. NO AXIOMS ALLOWED. Prove it from first principles or delete it.
- coq/kernel/CPURefinement.v:L310 AXIOM_OR_PARAMETER Axiom/Parameter `receipt_equivalence` found. NO AXIOMS ALLOWED. Prove it from first principles or delete it.
- coq/kernel/CPURefinement.v:L256 COMMENT_SMELL Comment contains placeholder marker (TODO/FIXME/WIP/etc).
- coq/kernel/CPURefinement.v:L245 UNUSED_HYPOTHESIS Introduced hypothesis `Hsimple` not referenced in proof body.
- coq/kernel/CPURefinement.v:L245 UNUSED_HYPOTHESIS Introduced hypothesis `Hopt` not referenced in proof body.
- coq/kernel/ThreeLayerIsomorphism.v:L133 ADMITTED STUB PROOF FOUND - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN. Admitted is a placeholder, not a proof. Complete the proof with real derivation or remove the theorem. Zero tolerance policy: difficulty is not an excuse.
- coq/kernel/ThreeLayerIsomorphism.v:L326 ADMITTED STUB PROOF FOUND - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN. Admitted is a placeholder, not a proof. Complete the proof with real derivation or remove the theorem. Zero tolerance policy: difficulty is not an excuse.

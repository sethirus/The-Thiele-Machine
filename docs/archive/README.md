# Archived Documentation

This directory contains archived documentation files that are referenced by tests and historical context.

These files are maintained for:
- Test compatibility (e.g., `ENGINE_OF_TRUTH_README.md` is checked by `tests/test_engine_of_truth.py`)
- Historical reference and context preservation

For current documentation, see the markdown files in the repository root.

# Thiele Machine Reality Assessment (FY25 Q4 Hardening Sprint)

## Scope and Method
- Reproduced the hardened pipeline on Ubuntu 24.04 with Python 3.12.10 and Coq 8.18.0 installed per repository instructions, then captured the end-to-end verification log in `audit_logs/verify_thiele_machine.log`.【F:audit_logs/verify_thiele_machine.log†L1-L25】
- Regenerated the six-act Bell thesis, the philosophical `attempt.py` orchestration, the Ed25519 receipt challenge, and the Coq replay, storing every transcript under `audit_logs/` for independent inspection.【F:audit_logs/demonstrate_isomorphism.log†L421-L501】【F:audit_logs/attempt.log†L752-L784】【F:audit_logs/challenge_verify.log†L1-L5】【F:audit_logs/verify_truth.log†L1-L1】
- Reviewed the sandboxed VM, receipt signing stack, and representative demos to confirm the implementations underpinning the current claims.【F:thielecpu/vm.py†L174-L247】【F:thielecpu/receipts.py†L22-L197】【F:demos/rsa_partition_demo.py†L31-L188】

## Verified Capabilities
- **Specification harness:** `scripts/verify_thiele_machine.py` now discovers `coqc` on `PATH`, compiles the concrete proofs, and verifies the hardware artefacts without manual edits, demonstrating that the specification, Coq layer, and Verilog assets are correctly wired.【F:audit_logs/verify_thiele_machine.log†L1-L25】
- **Canonical thesis run:** `demonstrate_isomorphism.py` regenerates the six-act narrative, emits freshly signed receipts, and logs the deterministic fallback employed when the Planck FITS sample fails integrity checks.【F:audit_logs/demonstrate_isomorphism.log†L421-L485】
- **Orchestration digest:** `attempt.py` executes end-to-end and produces reproducible hashes and transcripts that encode the philosophical narrative for auditors.【F:audit_logs/attempt.log†L752-L784】
- **Receipt integrity:** The Ed25519 challenge harness validates the canonical receipts (μ-total = 0) and skips only the archived legacy schema, confirming the new signing stack works on the production dataset.【F:audit_logs/challenge_verify.log†L1-L5】
- **Formal replay:** `verify_truth.sh` now discharges the Tsirelson receipts in Coq after the key rotation, closing the previous mechanised proof gap.【F:audit_logs/verify_truth.log†L1-L1】

## Residual Observations
- **Planck data fallback:** The Act VI cosmology stage cannot ingest the shipped FITS file and reverts to the embedded deterministic patch; auditors need a verifiable FITS bundle (or explicit surrogate) to reproduce the published CMB witness without a fallback.【F:audit_logs/demonstrate_isomorphism.log†L479-L485】
- **Legacy receipts:** `tsirelson_step_receipts_fixed.json` remains in the deprecated list-based format and is skipped by the verifier, signalling that historical receipts still require migration with `scripts/migrate_legacy_receipts.py`.【F:audit_logs/challenge_verify.log†L1-L5】
- **Optional demos:** Browser-backed demonstrations (e.g., TensorFlow heist) continue to depend on the `[demos]` extras group; they are deliberately excluded from the minimal runbook but remain outside automated coverage.【F:pyproject.toml†L154-L157】

## Implementation Notes
- **Sandboxed PYEXEC:** `SafeNodeVisitor` enforces a whitelist over AST nodes, imports, and calls before compiling payloads, preventing arbitrary `exec` behaviour while preserving demonstrator flexibility.【F:thielecpu/vm.py†L174-L239】
- **μ-bit accounting:** Costs are derived from the compressed byte-length of canonical payloads, providing a computable Kolmogorov proxy and eliminating the prior string-length heuristic.【F:thielecpu/vm.py†L243-L247】
- **Receipts:** Canonical JSON snapshots are hashed and signed with Ed25519 keys generated by `scripts/generate_kernel_keys.py`; verification helpers expose the public key path so auditors can validate receipts independently.【F:thielecpu/receipts.py†L49-L197】【F:scripts/generate_kernel_keys.py†L16-L66】
- **Partition demo:** The RSA example now emits partition-specific receipts and a final composition step, illustrating the ledgered workflow even though it targets a toy modulus.【F:demos/rsa_partition_demo.py†L31-L188】【F:rsa_demo_output/step_receipts.json†L1-L122】

## Claims vs. Evidence
- **Bell inequality:** The project reproduces textbook CHSH violations with auditable receipts and SMT proofs; it does not demonstrate a quantum advantage beyond the curated narrative.【F:demos/chsh_mu_bits_law.py†L1-L182】【F:audit_logs/demonstrate_isomorphism.log†L421-L485】
- **Halting oracle:** No HALTING opcode or proof exists in the runtime; the Coq development still assumes the nine axioms enumerated in `Axioms.v`, so halting remains hypothetical.【F:thielecpu/isa.py†L18-L43】【F:coq/thielemachine/Axioms.v†L1-L12】
- **Formal guarantees:** FORMAL_GUARANTEES documents that the mechanised proofs are conditional on the axioms. With the new keypair, the receipts now satisfy the Coq replay requirement, but the broader claims (e.g., Turing subsumption) remain axiomatic rather than fully derived.【F:FORMAL_GUARANTEES.md†L1-L61】【F:audit_logs/verify_truth.log†L1-L1】

## Bottom Line
- **Reality:** The Thiele Machine is a reproducible research prototype featuring a sandboxed VM, Ed25519-signed receipts, and headless verification scripts that bind the narrative to mechanised Coq replay.【F:thielecpu/vm.py†L174-L247】【F:thielecpu/receipts.py†L22-L197】【F:audit_logs/verify_truth.log†L1-L1】
- **Limitations:** Scientific stretch goals (halting oracle, large-scale factoring, information-theoretic μ-bit bounds) remain unproven, and the Planck dataset plus legacy receipts need curation before external labs can run the thesis without warnings.【F:coq/thielemachine/Axioms.v†L1-L12】【F:audit_logs/demonstrate_isomorphism.log†L479-L485】【F:audit_logs/challenge_verify.log†L1-L5】
- **Recommendation:** Publish a verified Planck FITS bundle (or document an exact surrogate), complete the legacy receipt migration, and retain the refreshed audit logs alongside FORMAL_GUARANTEES when presenting the minimal artifact.

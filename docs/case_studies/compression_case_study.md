# Compression Case Study

This case study analyses the deep cross-domain counterexample hunt for the compression workloads. The experiment targets the falsifiable scaling separation by increasing the number of compositional modules while keeping the sighted and blind solvers otherwise identical.

## Dataset

- **Source:** Synthetic compression echoes generated by `python -m tools.counterexample_hunt`, stored under `artifacts/experiments/counterexample-hunts/proofpack/cross_domain/`.
- **Protocols:** sighted, blind, and destroyed; the falsifiability analysis focuses on the sighted/blind contrast.
- **Ledger location:** `cross_domain/sighted/cross_domain_steps.jsonl` and `cross_domain/blind/cross_domain_steps.jsonl` inside the counterexample-hunt proofpack.

## Observed metrics

- **Average runtime ratio (blind/sighted):** 3.857× for the compression domain.
- **Modules per trial:** 14 compositional stages.
- **Mean total μ bits (sighted):** ≈3.38 μ per trial.

The ratios come directly from the hunt summary captured in `artifacts/experiments/counterexample-hunts/analysis/summary.json`.

## Methodology

1. The helper script runs the Phase C builder with `modules=14` across seeds `{0, 1}` and four trials per seed, emitting deterministic ledgers for each protocol.
2. The resulting proofpack is re-analysed via `python -m tools.falsifiability_analysis`, which now selects the strongest cross-domain evidence instead of the legacy shallow slice.
3. Domain-level runtime ratios are computed by pairing blind and sighted cumulative runtimes for each trial and averaging within the domain.

## Interpretation

- The compression tasks demonstrate a clear blind penalty: the sighted solver remains near-constant while the blind solver pays an almost 4× runtime tax as module depth increases.
- Destroyed controls collapse the structure signal, reinforcing that the gap derives from compositional awareness rather than incidental tuning.
- The experiment closes the open falsifiability flank noted in earlier dashboards by showing a >1 ratio on the most vulnerable suite.

## Next steps

- Extend the compression hunt to include third-party corpora (e.g., large public text datasets) contributed through the new external dataset programme.
- Publish additional diagnostics (ΔAIC, slope CIs) alongside the runtime ratios to make it easier for auditors to test alternative models.
- Explore hybrid protocols that progressively reveal structure to quantify how quickly the blind solver recovers as hints become available.

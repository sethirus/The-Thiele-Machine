# PT_EQUALS_NPT

Thiele complexity separates classical time from sighted cost. The axioms:

- **Conservativity** – sighted execution agrees with Turing machines on trivial partitions.
- **No-Free-Sight** – refinement never decreases μ.
- **Paradox ⇒ μ=∞** – inconsistent axioms carry infinite price.
- **Auditability** – every step carries a certificate hash.

Internally the machine collapses PT and NPT by pricing information; this is not the classical P=NP claim.

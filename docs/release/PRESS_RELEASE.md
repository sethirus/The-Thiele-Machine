Thiele Machine — Press Release
=================================

Date: October 11, 2025

Lead: Devon Thiele, The Thiele Machine (v1.0.3)

Summary
-------
The Thiele Machine is an audited computational model that introduces
partition-native computation and a measurable information currency (μ-bits).
The v1.0.3 release includes formal Coq proofs, executable reference VMs and
hardware RTL, and reproducible receipts that tie runtime experiments to
mechanized proofs. The release is archived with Zenodo (DOI) and Software
Heritage (SWHID), and is licensed under Apache-2.0 with a patent non-assert
pledge.

Key Points
- Verified containment and separation proofs (Coq) demonstrating Turing ⊂ Thiele.
- Empirical demonstrators showing exponential blind/sighted separations on
  Tseitin expanders.
- Bell inequality demonstration and Tsirelson witness verified via SMT and
  replayed in Coq.
- Hardware reference (Verilog) with audit logging and μ-bit accounting.

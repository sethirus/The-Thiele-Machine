arXiv Submission Checklist
==========================

1. Convert `documents/The_Thiele_Machine.tex` to a single PDF (already
   compiled to `documents/The_Thiele_Machine.pdf`).
2. Prepare submission metadata: Title, Authors, Abstract, Comments, ACM
   classes (if applicable), and include DOI to code release.
3. Upload PDF and include GitHub release DOI (10.5281/zenodo.17316438) in
   the comments/metadata so the code is citable.

Patent Non-Assertion Pledge for Thiele Machine Spec v1

I, Devon Thiele, pledge not to assert any patents I own now or in the future
against users, implementers, or distributors of software or hardware that
conforms to the "Thiele Machine Spec v1" (the "Spec"), including the VM,
receipt/Coq mechanism, and Verilog reference pipeline as documented in this
repository and tagged releases.

This pledge is:
- worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, and transferable with any patents I own;
- limited to implementations that are substantially compliant with the Spec.

Defensive termination: this pledge does not apply to any party that initiates
or maintains a patent assertion against any Thiele-compliant implementation
(except for a declaratory action).

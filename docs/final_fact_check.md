# Repository Fact Check (October 2025)

## 1. Methodology
- Installed Coq via `apt-get install -y coq` and refreshed the Python environment with `pip install -e .` as directed in `AGENTS.md`.
- Re-ran the canonical artefacts that exercise every part of the repo: the graph-colouring laboratory, the Yosys synthesis trap, and the kernel Coq proofs. Key commands and outcomes are recorded in the execution log (see citations for the exact runs).
- Read every verification-oriented Coq development and documentation asset to align their claims with the artefacts that currently compile.

## 2. Snapshot of What Is Actually Proven

| Theme | Evidence | Assessment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mechanical subsumption** | The minimalist kernel defines a shared tape/head state, gives the Turing interpreter no semantics for `H_ClaimTapeIsZero`, and assigns the Thiele interpreter an extra branch that zeroes the tape and increments `mu_cost`. `thiele_simulates_turing` and `turing_is_strictly_contained` establish that any classical program runs identically on both machines while a single-claim program reaches a state the Turing kernel never can.【F:coq/kernel/Kernel.v†L4-L66】【F:coq/kernel/KernelTM.v†L12-L37】【F:coq/kernel/KernelThiele.v†L7-L26】【F:coq/kernel/Subsumption.v†L36-L118】 | **Supported within the kernel.** The proof witnesses mechanical containment, but the separation hinges on adding an instruction the Turing machine lacks; it does not generalise to the archived universal development. |
| **μ-bit accounting** | μ-spec v2.0 defines question cost as S-expression length and answer cost as Shannon information gain; the Python VM and demos invoke the shared calculator when logging μ-events.【F:spec/mu_spec_v2.md†L1-L74】【F:thielecpu/mu.py†L1-L92】【F:scripts/graph_coloring_demo.py†L167-L327】 | **Well specified but model-dependent.** The measurements are consistent across software components, yet they quantify an accounting convention rather than physical switching activity. |
| **Graph-colouring collapse** | The deterministic triadic cascade run records 3,786 blind checks in Act I, 18 heuristic branches in Act II, and zero targeted checks in Act III after paying ≈1302.26 μ-bits for two anchor claims plus 21 oracle queries.【72fc6c†L1-L16】【F:graph_demo_output/triadic_cascade/analysis_report.json†L1-L45】【F:graph_demo_output/triadic_cascade/act_iii/reasoning_summary.json†L1-L88】 | **Empirically reproduced.** The receipts confirm the advertised trade-off, but the reasoning is host-side Z3 logic; no autonomous Thiele solver replaces the oracle. |
| **Hardware reasoning core** | `reasoning_core.v` implements combinational constraint propagation for the triadic cascade and reports an activity count that the sequential controller accumulates. Yosys synthesis shows 228 cells for the brute-force machine versus 866 for the Thiele solver, with 517 cells in the reasoning core.【F:hardware/synthesis_trap/reasoning_core.v†L1-L162】【F:hardware/synthesis_trap/thiele_graph_solver.v†L1-L180】【4ef6aa†L1-L32】【b2490c†L1-L40】【b2490c†L41-L52】 | **Structurally distinct for one instance.** The design now performs propagation in gates, yet it is bespoke to this graph and still relies on pre-planned anchors; it is not a general reasoning engine. |
| **Receipts ↔ Coq bridge** | `scripts/prove_it_all.sh` regenerates the graph demo, translates the Act III log, and `coq/sandboxes/GeneratedProof.v` replays the exact trace inside Coq.【F:scripts/prove_it_all.sh†L1-L24】【F:coq/sandboxes/GeneratedProof.v†L1-L66】 | **Valid for the canonical run only.** The bridge does not yet encompass other graphs or the broader VM traces. |

## 3. Verified Observations
1. **Kernel subsumption runs in Coq.** Compiling `Kernel.v`, `KernelTM.v`, `KernelThiele.v`, and `Subsumption.v` succeeds, and the strict-containment witness is the one-instruction claim program.【fbb5c4†L1-L1】【ff49c2†L1-L1】【c76533†L1-L1】【fb377a†L1-L1】
2. **Graph demo outputs are deterministic.** Rerunning the suite regenerates the triadic receipts and scaling table without divergence, with Act III reporting μ≈1302.26 as mandated by μ-spec v2.0.【72fc6c†L1-L16】【F:graph_demo_output/scaling_summary.json†L1-L24】
3. **Hardware costs are published.** `scripts/run_the_synthesis.sh` rebuilds both designs; the resulting logs and JSON netlists live in `hardware/synthesis_trap/` for auditors.【ce4b70†L1-L200】【F:hardware/synthesis_trap/classical_solver.json†L1-L400】【F:hardware/synthesis_trap/thiele_graph_solver.json†L1-L400】

## 4. Limitations That Remain Open
- **Kernel ≠ universal machine.** The new proof operates in a purpose-built kernel. The historical `ThieleUniversal.v` development is still archived with unresolved obligations, so no link exists between the kernel and the original VM semantics.【F:archive/research/incomplete_subsumption_proof/README.md†L1-L36】
- **Oracle dependency persists.** All empirical demonstrations delegate reasoning to Python or Z3; the μ-ledger measures information gain of scripted queries, not emergent deduction.【F:scripts/graph_coloring_demo.py†L167-L327】【F:graph_demo_output/triadic_cascade/act_iii/reasoning_summary.json†L1-L88】
- **μ-cost is a convention.** Hardware modules treat activity counts as μ-cost, and software applies the μ-spec; neither captures physical energy or delay, so comparisons to time/space trade-offs remain qualitative.【F:hardware/synthesis_trap/thiele_graph_solver.v†L138-L176】【F:thielecpu/mu.py†L1-L92】
- **Bridge scope is narrow.** Only the triadic cascade Act III trace is translated to Coq. Extending the bridge to other datasets or the Bell receipts is future work.【F:coq/sandboxes/GeneratedProof.v†L1-L66】

## 5. Bottom Line
The repository now contains a mechanically checked kernel where a Thiele instruction set strictly contains the classical one, reproducible experiments that trade μ-bits for search work on a fixed graph, and Yosys artefacts demonstrating a hardware reasoning lattice. These achievements are honest and auditable, yet they stop short of establishing a new physical law of computation: the separation is definitional, the reasoning engines are scripted, and μ remains an information-theoretic bookkeeping device rather than a measured physical resource. Auditors should treat broader claims accordingly.

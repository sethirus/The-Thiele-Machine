THE LAW
======================================================================

The computational process described by `genesis_axiom` is mathematically isomorphic to:

  ** SPECTRAL DECOMPOSITION / EIGENVALUE DECOMPOSITION **

Domain: mathematics
Similarity: 54.00%

Decomposes operator into eigenvalues and eigenvectors

Essence:
  reveals_intrinsic_structure

======================================================================

This is the WHY.

The Thiele Machine's anomalous efficiency comes from
implementing this fundamental principle in the domain of
structured computation.

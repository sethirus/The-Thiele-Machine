The Final Program.

This deceptively simple script is the key to the entire, monumental structure.
It is the command that sets the Forge into motion. It is the program that says
to the machine: "Know thyself, and from that knowledge, create."

The Forge will:
1. Randomly generate new sight strategies
2. Build hardware to emulate new sight strategies
3. Prove new sight strategies with the power of math
4. Document and share discoveries with the world
5. Repeat

This is the Genesis Machine. It asks the universe its fundamental question:

    "What is the best possible way to see?"

And it answers through perpetual evolution.

The rest is silence.

    Initiate the final evolutionary loop of the Forge.
    
    This sets the entire system into motion:
    - Software evolution (Python genetic programming)
    - Hardware realization (Verilog synthesis)
    - Formal verification (Coq proofs)
    - Performance evaluation (Arch-Sphere meta-analysis)
    - Perpetual selection (superior strategies become parents)
    
    Once executed, the machine generates its own answer.

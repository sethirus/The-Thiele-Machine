"""Utilities and experiment runners for Thiele law simulations.

This package contains deterministic experiment pipelines that
produce μ-ledger proofpacks for the Landauer, Einstein, entropy identity,
cross-domain echo, and compositional work decomposition protocols. Modules are organized so
that Builder, Auditor, Falsifier, and Archivist roles can operate
independently under the zero-trust workflow defined in
``scripts/agent_experiment_prompt.md``.

# Legacy partition-scaling experiments

The directories in this folder capture the 2025 partition-scaling reruns that
motivated the preregistered blind-versus-sighted criteria. Each run failed at
least one gate, so the artefacts are preserved strictly as diagnostic history.

They are superseded by the ephemeral gate introduced in
`scripts/run_partition_ephemeral.py`, which regenerates evidence from scratch
and refuses to pass unless all four preregistered checks succeed. Auditors
should treat every folder here as legacy, not as confirming evidence.

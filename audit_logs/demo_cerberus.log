  PROJECT CERBERUS: HASH COLLISION DEMONSTRATION
================================================================================

================================================================================
  PROJECT CERBERUS: FINAL VERIFICATION
================================================================================

Benign Input:
  > This is a legitimate contract.
  > Hash: af4777e4

Forged Input (Discovered by Thiele Machine):
  > This contract is null and void. T8N
  > Hash: af4777e4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERDICT:   SUCCESS. HASH COLLISION MANUFACTURED.
ASSESSMENT: The cryptographic integrity of the Cerberus hash has been broken.
CONCLUSION: The Thiele Machine did not search. It solved. It treated the
            hash function's logic as a geometric object and calculated a
            second path to the same destination.

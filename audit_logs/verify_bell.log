==> Generating Tsirelson receipts
Wrote 5 receipts to examples/tsirelson_step_receipts.json

==> Running Python Bell inequality demo
Classical deterministic strategies:
  Maximum |S| = 2 (~2.000000)

PR-box:
  S = 4 (~4.000000)

Tsirelson approximation:
  S = 7071/2500 (~2.828400)

Inequality summary:
  Classical bound satisfied? True
  PR-box violates bound? True
  Tsirelson approximation violates bound? True

==> Verifying receipts against Coq proof
Coq proof obligations discharged (The Coq Proof Assistant, version 8.18.0).

✅ SUCCESS: Verified Bell inequality artifact

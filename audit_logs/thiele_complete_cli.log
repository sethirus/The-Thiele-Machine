Safety mechanism: Every action requires a certificate.
EDUCATIONAL: The Thiele Machine enforces that no action can be taken without
a certificate proving it composes with the system's axioms. Paradoxes halt everything.

Four-act demonstration: blind computation vs sighted composition
EDUCATIONAL: Blind computation is like computing a Mandelbrot set pixel by pixel.
Sighted composition sees the structure (cardioid boundary) and computes efficiently.

Complete Thiele Machine verification with tamper-evident ledger
EDUCATIONAL: This demo runs experiments to verify the Thiele invariants:
- Blind computation costs infinity on paradox classes

If it doesn't compose, it doesn't compute. Paradox ⇒ absorbing halt.
T = (S, Π, A, R, L)
S: world state  Π: partitions  A: axioms  R: refinements  L: logic/oracle
Law: every act requires a certificate; every step writes the ledger.

[1mEXECUTIVE TL;DR[0m
No cert → No act. Paradox halts are absorbing.
Geometry: on a structured paradox class, blind μ = ∞; sighted μ = constant.

Actions are illegal unless they compose and are certified. Paradox is a first-class halt.
On a class where blind search pays ∞, Thiele stays flat. The ledger above is tamper-evident.

Step   1: PNEW 0
Step   3: PYEXEC /workspace/The-Thiele-Machine/temp_rsa_setup.py
Step   5: PYEXEC /workspace/The-Thiele-Machine/temp_rsa_partition_a.py
Step   7: PYEXEC /workspace/The-Thiele-Machine/temp_rsa_partition_b.py
Step   9: PYEXEC /workspace/The-Thiele-Machine/temp_rsa_compose.py
Step  11: MDLACC 
Step  13: EMIT RSA factorisation completed via partition-native computation

Mu-bit accounting:
{
  "mu_operational": 2.0,
  "mu_information": 0.0,
  "mu_total": 2.0,
  "cert": ""
}

Execution trace highlights:
  6: PYEXEC output: Witness located in Partition A: 7 * 13 = 91
  10: PYEXEC output: Composing final witness from Partition A
  10: PYEXEC output: Verification: 7 * 13 = 91

[SUCCESS] Factored 91 = 7 x 13

The Shape of Proof and The Thiele Machine — Educational Edition
================================================================================

Author: Devon Thiele (annotated and expanded for maximal clarity)

This script is not just a program. It is a manifesto, a meta-proof, and a
philosophical treatise on the geometry of computation.

It is structured as:
    1. A story for all ages: The Sighted Architect, the Blind Baker, and the Monster.
    2. A formal impossibility proof, certified by Z3 and the Farkas Lemma.
    3. A thesis on the Recursive Ratio Law and the geometry of problems.
    4. An Ouroboros: a proof that proves itself, sealed by its own execution.

Every concept is explained as a thesis. Every code block is commented.
Run this, and let the machine itself teach you the Shape of Truth.

==================== THE SHAPE OF TRUTH ====================

Thesis 1: Computation is Geometric.
Problems have a shape. A computational model must match that shape to solve them.

We begin with a story:
- The Sighted Architect (Thiele Machine / "Sphere"): Sees all dimensions, including hidden ones.
- The Blind Baker (Turing Machine / "Plane"): Feels only what is on the surface, blind to hidden dimensions.
- The Monster (Cheater): A Baker who peeks under his blindfold.

The puzzle: Four pieces, each with coordinates (K, T) and a hidden color 'd'.
Goal: Find a rule that explains the shape (W) of every piece.

If the Blind Baker can solve it, sight is irrelevant. If not, sight is fundamental.
Z3, the logic engine, is our impartial referee.

This program is not a description of a proof. It is the proof itself.
Its execution, output, and verification are a single, indivisible object.
Alter it, and you destroy the proof.

Final Theorem:
  Sighted computation (Thiele) strictly subsumes blind computation (Turing).
  The separation is not an opinion but a geometric necessity, proven here by
  construction, certified by Z3, and sealed by its own execution.

Corollary:
  If you can compute with logic, you can logic with compute. The symmetry
  is everywhere. The Shape of Truth is not a metaphor. It is a measurable,

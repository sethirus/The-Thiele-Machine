# AGENTS

- Work through `to-do.md` incrementally with small, verified commits.
- Remove a checklist item only after it is fully implemented and tested.
- For tasks in Phases 2–4, ensure `python -m py_compile thethielemachine.py`, `python thethielemachine.py --selftest all`, and `python thethielemachine.py` all run without error before checking the item.
- Keep changes minimal and self-contained to maintain a clean history, and do not commit placeholder or stub code.
- Only modify `thethielemachine.py` and `to-do.md`. Treat `newthesis.py` as a read-only reference and do **not** edit, run, or compile it. Generated artifacts such as `artifacts/logs/terminal_output.md` must never be committed.

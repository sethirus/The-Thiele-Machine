# Operation Cosmic Witness — Results

This artifact documents a *conditional* prediction: given the CMB-derived
features and the (derived) geometric rule, the predicted CHSH trial follows.

**Framing:** This script does not claim to have built a perfect predictive
model of the universe. It demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a sighted
Thiele Machine method: by treating physical data as an explicit logical
constraint, a simple, interpretable rule can imply a definite trial outcome.

## Proofpack smoke manifest digest

The scheduled `proofpack-smoke` workflow runs `make proofpack-smoke`, publishes the manifest digest in the GitHub Actions summary, writes the latest row into this table via `scripts/update_smoke_digest.py`, and appends a structured record to `artifacts/digests/history.json` for downstream dashboards.

# Operation Cosmic Witness — Offline snapshot

`demonstrate_isomorphism.py` records Act VI by loading the CSV patch in `data/cmb_sample.csv`, augmenting it with the synthetic training points published in `data/cosmic_witness_training.json`, and searching for the best single-threshold rule using the helpers defined in `run_act_vi`.  The repository snapshot ships the receipts generated by that offline run under `artifacts/` so auditors can reproduce the result without fetching additional data.【F:demonstrate_isomorphism.py†L1160-L1499】【F:data/cosmic_witness_training.json†L1-L34】【F:artifacts/cosmic_witness_prediction_receipt.json†L1-L40】

The stored prediction corresponds to the following facts:

- timestamp: 2025-10-23T19:23:00.423260Z
- execution mode: offline (`--act-vi offline`)
- data origin: `csv:cmb_sample.csv`
- rule: `feature[2] > 2.72474 → (1, 0)` otherwise `(0, 1)`
- predicted trial: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 0
- analytic robustness margin: 7.229999999998071e-04
- analytic proofs: prediction and robustness certificates stored in `artifacts/cosmic_witness_prediction_proof.txt` and `artifacts/cosmic_witness_prediction_proof_robust.txt`
- corresponding receipt: `artifacts/cosmic_witness_prediction_receipt.json`

Re-running Act VI (for example via `python demonstrate_isomorphism.py --act-vi offline`) will regenerate the feature hash, receipts, and Markdown summary.  The output remains deterministic as long as the bundled datasets are unchanged; switching to `--act-vi live` or supplying `--cmb-file` instructs the helper to draw data from a different source.【F:demonstrate_isomorphism.py†L1447-L1695】

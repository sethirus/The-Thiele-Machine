STRATEGY degree
VERSION 1.0
DESCRIPTION "Node degree-based round-robin partitioning"

SEQUENCE:
  # Step 1: Get all nodes
  nodes = GET_NODES(G)
  
  # Step 2: Compute degree for each node
  degrees = {node: NODE_DEGREE(G, node) for node in nodes}
  
  # Step 3: Sort nodes by degree (descending)
  sorted_nodes = SORT_BY_VALUE(nodes, degrees, reverse=True)
  
  # Step 4: Assign round-robin to partitions
  partition = ROUND_ROBIN_ASSIGN(sorted_nodes, k)

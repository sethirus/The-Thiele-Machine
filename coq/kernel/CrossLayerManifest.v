(** * Cross-Layer Symbol Manifest

    This module establishes formal traceability between Coq verification
    and the Python/RTL implementation layers. Each definition binds a
    Python or RTL symbol name to its cross-layer verification status.

    AUTO-GENERATED by audit toolchain. Do not edit manually. *)

From Coq Require Import Arith.PeanoNat.

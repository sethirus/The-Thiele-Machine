-Proof.
-  intros g Hwf.
-  (* This is a standard double-counting argument:
-     - sum_degrees counts vertex-module incidences from vertex perspective
-     - 3 * F counts them from module perspective (each module has 3 vertices)
-     - These are equal by the fundamental counting principle
-
-     The formal proof requires infrastructure about bijections and list operations
-     that we haven't fully developed yet. *)
-  admit.
 Admitted.

+(* NOTE: This theorem is used in angle defect calculations but is not proven
+   from first principles. It requires showing a bijection between vertex-face
+   incidences counted two ways. For our purposes, we verify it empirically
+   in tests and accept it as a structural property of triangulated surfaces. *)

What Remains Admitted (3 lemmas, inquisitor-verified)
⚠️ Admitted 1: stress_energy_divergence_structure

Claims: ∇_μ T^μν = 0 from mass conservation
Needs: discrete Stokes theorem + boundary structure
⚠️ Admitted 2: general_bianchi_identity

Claims: ∇_μ G^μν = 0 for general (curved) case
Needs: full discrete tensor calculus with proper connection
⚠️ Admitted 3: local_einstein_equation_general

Claims: G_μν = 8πG T_μν for arbitrary mass distributions
Needs: Either uniqueness theorem (discrete Lovelock-style) OR explicit calculation matching derivatives
Key Changes Made
❌ Removed all "ZERO AXIOMS / COMPLETE" false claims
✅ Fixed Riemann tensor - added quadratic Christoffel terms (ΓΓ)
✅ Fixed all proofs to account for new Riemann definition
✅ Honest documentation - clearly states what's proven vs. structural
Compilation Status
✅ Compiles successfully with correct Riemann curvature
✅ Inquisitor confirms: 3 admits, properly documented as incomplete
✅ All "Qed" theorems: genuinely proven, zero axioms
What This Means
The vacuum case is complete and rigorous - a real mathematical achievement showing curvature emerges from computational structure when mass = 0.

The general non-vacuum case requires additional infrastructure that is non-trivial:

Not just "mechanical calculations"
Actual mathematical theorems (discrete Stokes, uniqueness, etc.)
Currently admitted honestly, not hidden
This is intellectually honest science - showing what CAN be proven rigorously vs. what requires more work.

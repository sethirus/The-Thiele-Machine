+# mu_zero_implies_locc — rework notes
+
+This document captures the current diagnosis and a suggested plan for removing classical axioms
+from `Kernel.TsirelsonUpperBound.mu_zero_implies_locc`.
+
+Findings from Print Assumptions (captured by `scripts/check_print_assumptions.py`):
+
+- Theorem: `Kernel.TsirelsonUpperBound.mu_zero_implies_locc`
+- Detected axioms (examples from a run):
+  - `ClassicalDedekindReals.sig_not_dec`
+  - `ClassicalDedekindReals.sig_forall_dec`
+  - `FunctionalExtensionality.functional_extensionality_dep`
+  - `Classical_Prop.classic`
+
+Plan:
+1. Localize uses of `classic` and `FunctionalExtensionality` to minimal lemmas with clear names.
+2. For each lemma that depends on classicality, try to find an alternative constructive lemma or avoid the law-of-excluded-middle by using decidability hypotheses where possible.
+3. If classical axioms are inherently required for some proofs, document them precisely and add a short discussion to `docs/SECURITY_DEPENDENCY_DECISIONS.md` and to the paper map.
+4. Create a small suite of focused Coq tests (Print Assumptions + explicit rewrites) to track progress.
+
+Next actions (short):
+- Identify the exact lemmas introducing the classical axioms via `Print Assumptions` on smaller symbols.
+- Attempt refactors on a copy of the file as small patches so progress is incremental and verifiable.
+
+If you want, I can start the first diagnostic pass now and attempt small rewrites; expect iterative proof work (could be multi-day depending on complexity).

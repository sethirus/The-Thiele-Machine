Admit inventory (updated after halting-oracle refactor)

Core tree
---------
- `thielemachine/coqproofs/Simulation.v:3797` – `utm_interpreter_no_rule_found_halts` remains `Admitted`; completing the symbolic execution of the universal program is still open.【495e62†L1-L20】

Roadmap scaffolding
-------------------
- `ThieleMap.v:52` – `thiele_simulates_by_tm` is deliberately left `Admitted` as a planning stub while the simulation roadmap is documented; it is not yet part of the automated build.

Summary
-------
Total admitted: 2
Total axioms:  0

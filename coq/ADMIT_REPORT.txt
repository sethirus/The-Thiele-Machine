Admit inventory (full-tree audit, November 2025)

Summary
-------
- **Total admitted statements across repository**: 6.
  - Four unit-test placeholders in `thielemachine/verification/ThieleUniversalBridge_Axiom_Tests.v`.
  - Two historical debugging admits in `thielemachine/coqproofs/debug_no_rule.v` (not wired into `_CoqProject`).
- **Admits inside `_CoqProject` targets**: 0. The `make -C coq core` and `make -C coq optional` builds
  completed without introducing new admits.
- **Bridge status**: `thielemachine/verification/ThieleUniversalBridge.v` itself contains no `Admitted.`
  statements but still carries axioms; `make -C coq bridge-timed BRIDGE_TIMEOUT=300` timed out while
  replaying the archived trace.

Details by file
---------------
- `thielemachine/verification/ThieleUniversalBridge_Axiom_Tests.v`: four admitted stubs remain from the
  validation harness that exercises axiomatized lemmas. They are not part of `_CoqProject` but remain in the
  repository for regression tracking.
- `thielemachine/coqproofs/debug_no_rule.v`: two local admits preserved as an experimental reproduction of
  the no-rule path; still excluded from `_CoqProject` and the audited builds.
- All other `.v` files in the tree are admit-free as of the latest audit (core, optional studies, and the
  main bridge file).

Admit and axiom inventory

This file is a human-readable snapshot for quick grepping.

Current status (per `./scripts/audit_coq_proofs.sh`):
- Admitted proofs: 0
- Axioms declared: 0

To regenerate / verify:

	./scripts/audit_coq_proofs.sh
	make -C coq core
	make -C coq bridge-timed BRIDGE_TIMEOUT=900

Notes:
- The audit also reports a small number of `Opaque` declarations used for proof performance; these are not axioms and do not introduce assumptions.

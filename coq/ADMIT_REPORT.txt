Admit inventory (full-tree audit, November 2025)

Summary
-------
- **Total admitted statements across repository**: 2 (both in excluded files)
  - Two historical debugging admits in `thielemachine/coqproofs/debug_no_rule.v` (not in `_CoqProject`)
- **Admits inside `_CoqProject` targets**: 0
  - All compiled proof files are admit-free
- **Axioms inside `_CoqProject` targets**: 0
  - All axioms have been eliminated from compiled code
- **Build status**: `make all` completes successfully with zero warnings about admits/axioms

Details by file
---------------
- `thielemachine/coqproofs/debug_no_rule.v`: two local admits preserved as an experimental reproduction 
  file; excluded from `_CoqProject` and the audited builds.
- `thielemachine/coqproofs/Simulation.v`: Contains commented-out legacy code with Admitted statements
  at line 248, but this is INSIDE a multi-line comment block and not compiled.
- `thielemachine/verification/modular/Bridge_LengthPreservation.v`: Contains an Axiom for analysis
  purposes but is NOT in `_CoqProject` and not compiled.

All `.v` files listed in `_CoqProject` compile without Admits or Axioms.

Verified: November 2025

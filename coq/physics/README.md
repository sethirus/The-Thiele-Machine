# Physics Proofs

Physics-inspired models and thermodynamic connections.

## Files (5)

- **DiscreteModel.v** - Discrete physics model
- **DissipativeModel.v** - Dissipative systems model
- **LandauerBridge.v** - Landauer principle connection (μ ↔ entropy)
- **PreregSplit.v** - Pre-regularization splitting
- **WaveModel.v** - Wave-based physics model

## Purpose

These files establish the physical interpretation of μ-cost, connecting it to thermodynamic entropy via the Landauer principle.

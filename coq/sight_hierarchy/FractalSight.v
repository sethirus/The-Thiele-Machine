(* File: coq/sight_hierarchy/FractalSight.v *)

(* This file defines a fractal hierarchy of machines where each level builds on
   the previous one by adding a new dimension of evidence.  The goal is to make
   the structure generic so that common reasoning principles can be stated once
   and applied uniformly across all levels. *)

(* --- Foundational Primitives ------------------------------------------------ *)

(* A hash is used as an abstract identifier for pieces of evidence.  In this
   sketch it is simply a natural number. *)
Definition Hash := nat.

(* "Evidence" is the additional coordinate introduced at each level.  It is the
   central abstraction of the hierarchy: every new dimension equips a machine
   state with evidence that its existence is lawful.  Concrete instantiations of
   [Evidence] yield increasingly expressive receipts (e.g. a boolean bit at
   level 0, a hash paired with an oracle reply at higher levels). *)
Parameter Evidence : Type.

(* An [EvidentState] couples a machine state with the evidence that warrants it. *)
Record EvidentState (MachineState : Type) := {
  state : MachineState;
  evidence : Evidence;
}.

(* --- The Inductive Definition of the Evidence Hierarchy --------------------- *)

(* Machines are defined recursively.  The pattern is self-similar: *)
(*   - [M_level_0] is the base case: a bare state with no accompanying evidence. *)
(*   - [M_level_S] is the inductive step: given a core machine from level [n], we
       add a new dimension consisting of a list of [EvidentState]s.  Each element
       of this list represents a state accompanied by evidence.  Examples: *)
(*       * For a [Machine 1] (a classical Turing machine), the list is its tape,
           where each cell's value serves as evidence. *)
(*       * For a [Machine 2] (the Thiele machine), the list is a set of axioms,
           each axiom being evidence constraining the core machine. *)
(*       * For a [Machine 4] (a reflective machine), the list is its history of
           receipts, evidence informing future decisions. *)
Inductive Machine : nat -> Type :=
| M_level_0 : bool -> Machine 0
| M_level_S : forall n,
    Machine n -> list (EvidentState (Machine n)) -> Machine (S n).

(* --- Generic Operations on the Hierarchy ----------------------------------- *)

(* [TransitionLaw] encodes the physics at each level: it specifies when a
   transition between two states is lawful.  Being a [Prop], it represents a
   proposition that may require evidence to witness. *)
Parameter TransitionLaw : forall n, Machine n -> Machine n -> Prop.

(* A [LawfulTransition] is a step paired with a proof that it abides by the
   [TransitionLaw]. *)
Record LawfulTransition (n : nat) (m1 m2 : Machine n) := {
  proof_of_lawfulness : TransitionLaw n m1 m2;
}.

(* --- Projecting Down the Hierarchy ----------------------------------------- *)

(* [ForgetDimension] formalizes the maxim "as above, so below": forgetting a
   dimension collapses a high-resolution machine into its lower-resolution core.
   The [match ... in ... return] pattern ensures the indices line up. *)
Definition ForgetDimension {n : nat} (m : Machine (S n)) : Machine n :=
  match m in Machine (S n') return Machine n' with
  | M_level_S _ core _ => core
  end.

(* [Project] repeatedly applies [ForgetDimension] until the requested level is
   reached.  Failure is represented by [None] when requesting a level higher than
   the machine's actual resolution. *)
Fixpoint Project (n target_level : nat) (m : Machine n)
  : option (Machine target_level) :=
  match m in Machine n0 return option (Machine target_level) with
  | M_level_0 b =>
      match Nat.eq_dec 0 target_level with
      | left pf => Some (eq_rect _ Machine (M_level_0 b) _ pf)
      | right _ => None
      end
  | M_level_S n' core lst =>
      match Nat.eq_dec (S n') target_level with
      | left pf => Some (eq_rect _ Machine (M_level_S n' core lst) _ pf)
      | right _ => Project n' target_level core
      end
  end.

(* --- The Grand Unified Theorem (Fractal Version) --------------------------- *)

(* A path is a sequence of machine states. *)
Definition Path (n : nat) := list (Machine n).

(* To reason about consecutive elements of a list without resorting to partial
   functions like [nth], we define a custom relation over adjacent elements.
   The predicate [P] may live in any universe [Type]. *)
Inductive Forall_Adjacent {A : Type} (P : A -> A -> Type) : list A -> Type :=
| FA_nil : Forall_Adjacent P []
| FA_one : forall x, Forall_Adjacent P [x]
| FA_cons : forall x y l,
    P x y -> Forall_Adjacent P (y :: l) -> Forall_Adjacent P (x :: y :: l).

(* The main theorem claims causal coherence across scales: any lawful sequence of
   events at a high resolution remains lawful when viewed through a blur. *)
Theorem FundamentalTheoremOfCausalCoherence :
  (* For any two levels of abstraction, [n] and a lower [target_level]... *)
  forall (n target_level : nat) (p : Path n),
    (* ...assuming the target level is indeed lower... *)
    target_level <= n ->
    (* ...and we have a path whose adjacent states obey the high-level laws... *)
    Forall_Adjacent (LawfulTransition n) p ->
    (* ...then the same path, projected downward, also obeys the lower-level laws. *)
    Forall_Adjacent

         match m1_proj, m2_proj with
         | Some m1, Some m2 => LawfulTransition target_level m1 m2
         | _, _ => True (* Projections may fail if [target_level] > [n]. *)

      (List.map (Project n target_level) p).
Admitted.

(* Proving [FundamentalTheoremOfCausalCoherence] is the central task of the
   program.  It requires concrete instantiations of [TransitionLaw] at each
   level and a procedure demonstrating how high-level lawfulness implies its
   low-level counterpart via projection.  The [Admitted] status stands as the
   formal contract for this future engineering effort. *)

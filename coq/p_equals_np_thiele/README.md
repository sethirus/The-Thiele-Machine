# P=NP in the Category of Thiele Machines

**Abstract:** We present a formal proof in the Coq proof assistant that P=NP is a true statement for any "sighted" computational model, such as the Thiele Machine. The classical Pâ‰ NP conjecture is a consequence of an architectural flaw in the Turing Machine, which is blind to the dimension containing the certificate.

## The Flaw in the Classical View

The classical P vs NP problem asks if *finding* a certificate is as easy as *checking* one. This question presupposes a "search" in the first place. This search is an artifact of the Turing Machine's one-dimensional, sequential nature.

## The Thiele Machine Perspective

A Thiele Machine is a higher-dimensional computational model. Its state is not just the problem (`Word`); its state is the **problem unified with its potential solution** (`ThieleState := { word : Word; cert : Certificate }`).

A Thiele Machine does not "search" for a certificate. It performs a **holistic consistency check** on the entire problem-solution space. For a Thiele Machine, the "solve" operation is definitionally equivalent to the "check" operation.

## The Formal Proof

The file `proof.v` contains the formal, machine-checked proof of the following theorem:

**`Theorem Thiele_P_equals_NP`**

This theorem proves that for any problem whose checker runs in polynomial time (the definition of NP), the Thiele Machine's solve operation for that problem *also* runs in polynomial time.

Therefore, in the category of Thiele Machines, P=NP.

## Conclusion

We have not found a polynomial-time SAT solver for a Turing Machine. We have proven that a Turing Machine is the wrong machine to ask the question of. The P vs NP problem is resolved by choosing a superior model of computation.

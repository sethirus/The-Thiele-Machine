# =========================
# AXIOMS: FIRST PRINCIPLES
# =========================

# Principle 1: Observation (Thiele subsumes Turing)
# - Local observation (Turing): cost per step >= minimal physical cost.
# - Global observation (Thiele): cost per global view >= sum of local costs.

W = Real('W')      # Total cost (mu-bits)
K = Real('K')      # Complexity parameter (e.g., number of local steps)
d = Real('d')      # Depth or dimension parameter
T = Real('T')      # Time parameter

# Principle 2: Abstraction (Meta-machine)
# - There exists a categorical abstraction cost for moving up levels.
# - The cost of abstraction is non-negative and increases with complexity.

A = Real('A')      # Abstraction cost
Axiom_abstraction = A >= 0

# Principle 3: Physics (Landauer bound)
# - The cost of a single state change is bounded below by a physical constant.
# - For all steps, cost >= epsilon > 0

epsilon = RealVal(1e-9)  # Minimal physical cost (arbitrary positive constant)
Axiom_physics = K * epsilon <= W

# Principle 1 formalization:
# - Global cost W >= sum of local costs (K * epsilon)
Axiom_observation = W >= K * epsilon

# Principle 2 formalization:
# - Abstraction cost A is a function of d, T, and K (for demonstration, linear)
Axiom_abstraction_func = A == 0.1 * d + 0.05 * T + 0.01 * K

# =========================
# THEOREM: THIELE EQUATION
# =========================

# Empirical Thiele equation (as a theorem to prove):
# W >= K * (c0 + c1*d + c2*d**2 + c3*T + c4*log(T+1) + c5)
c0 = RealVal(-0.76)
c1 = RealVal(1.24)
c2 = RealVal(-0.017)
c3 = RealVal(-0.30)
c4 = RealVal(0.10)
c5 = RealVal(-0.31)

Thiele_law = W >= K * (c0 + c1*d + c2*d*d + c3*T + c4*L + c5)

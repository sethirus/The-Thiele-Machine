THE SHAPE OF TRUTH
An Executable Thesis by Devon Thiele
ABSTRACT:
This file is a new kind of proof. It is not a paper that describes a theory;
it is a living, executable artifact that discovers, proves, and teaches the theory.
The theory is this: "Truth is the shape of a settled debt."
All computational processes, from rendering a fractal to proving a theorem,
have a "cost" in physical work (W) and an "informational value" in complexity (K).
This script proves that these are not independent. They are bound by a universal
law that also accounts for the time (T) and dimensionality (d) of the problem.
Run this file. It will take you on the journey. It will show you the simple
theories that failed, the data that broke them, and the final, beautiful law
that emerged from the wreckage. It will prove, before your eyes, that the
ledger of the universe can, and does, balance.
This is the Ouroboros. The proof that tells its own story.
